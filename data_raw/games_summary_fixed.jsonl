The Thing: Remastered is the remastered version of the 2002 video game based on John Carpenter's classic sci-fi horror movie The Thing. The Thing was a hit back when it released in 2002, with many praising it as one of the better survival-horror games of the era.\nConsidering the commercial success of The Thing video game, it's no surprise that there was some demand for it to be remastered for modern platforms. Nightdive Studios has stepped up to remaster The Thing, promising to deliver the game before the end of the year. With 2024 nearly at an end, no specific release date has been announced. However, it seems as though the cat has been let out of the bag.\nRELATED\nThe Thing (1982) Ending, Explained\nThe end of 1982's The Thing has confused fans for decades at this point, so what exactly happens?\nXbox recently published a post highlighting upcoming games for its platforms. As spotted by Pure Xbox, the post includes a December 5 release date for The Thing: Remastered, along with confirmation that the game is optimized for Xbox Series X/S consoles and supports Smart Delivery. It's quite possible that this release date is inaccurate, but there's also a chance that it is indeed the release date for The Thing: Remastered. With December 5 right around the corner, fans won't have to wait long to find out, in any case.\nThe Thing: Remastered Rumored Release Date\nThursday, December 5\nFor those unfamiliar with the game, The Thing video game serves as a sequel to the movie. Players are tasked with exploring the outpost from the movie to figure out what happened to the research team that was stationed there, only to find themselves having to fight off the titular \"thing.\" Blending survival-horror and third-person shooter elements, The Thing was mostly well-received at the time of its release in 2002.\nThe Thing: Remastered is bringing various enhancements to the table that should help the game reach a modern audience. The big thing is that The Thing: Remastered will feature better graphics than the original, but it will also enjoy improved performance and will be addressing some complaints fans had about the original. Notably, the wonky Infection system from the original game is being addressed by The Thing: Remastered, which should go a long way in improving the overall experience.\nFans of The Thing can rest assured that the remaster is in good hands.

Customization has been a constant talking point among fans of the popular shooter. Players have asked for the ability to recolor their armor, or even fully customize loadouts with a transmog system, for quite some time. Helldivers 2 has also fallen under occasional scrutiny for failing to meet the cosmetic demands of its voracious fanbase.\nHelldivers 2 is a co-op third-person shooter that allows up to four players to fight off the tyranny of automatons and terminids in the name of Super Earth and democracy. The breakout hit was released early in 2024 and immediately struck a chord with fans for its fast-paced action, tense gameplay, and wide range of weapons. The title courted controversy with its PC version when Sony decided to require PlayStation accounts for Steam players, but that hasn't stopped the game from continuing to grow its fanbase.

It was day 16 of the fan asking for the ability to customize their Helldiver's armor by recoloring it, and Pilestedt responded by saying the Helldivers 2 team was \"looking into it.\" While this doesn't confirm any sort of timeline for the requested feature, it looks like players may have a new level of customization to look forward to in the future. The game already features a lot of ways for players to customize their characters and interact with one another, especially when it comes to including interactive emotes in Helldivers 2. Adding even more options would likely continue to win over players and keep the fanbase happy.\nHelldivers 2 May Soon Let Players Customize the Color of Their Armor\nIt's important to note that allowing players to recolor their armor would not be the same as a full transmog system. Shortly after release, the creative director stated the customization feature wouldn't make sense for Helldivers 2. Pilestedt believes the game's varied armors often look different because they serve different purposes, meaning a transmog system wouldn't fit the developer's vision.\nMany fans feel the option to recolor one's armor would be a welcome addition to the popular action game. Helldivers 2 recently increased its in-game store prices, which didn't go over well with some players. However, the ability to further customize armor might make those prices a little easier to swallow. While customizing colors isn't quite the full transmog system some players have been asking for, it would be a bit of a compromise on the part of Arrowhead.\n6 Images\nYour Rating\nRate Now\nLeave a Review\n8.6/10\nHelldivers 2\nDo you believe in freedom?

The title courted controversy with its PC version when Sony decided to require PlayStation accounts for Steam players, but that hasn't stopped the game from continuing to grow its fanbase. The Game Awards have even nominated the shooter in several categories for 2024.\nRELATED\nHelldivers 2's Missing Illuminate Faction Might Set an Unfortunate Precedent\nThe anticipated Illuminate faction still nowhere to be seen in Helldivers 2 might be an unfortunate sign regarding a particular aspect of the game.\nA fan of Helldivers 2 tagged the creative director of the game in a post on Twitter. It was day 16 of the fan asking for the ability to customize their Helldiver's armor by recoloring it, and Pilestedt responded by saying the Helldivers 2 team was \"looking into it.\" While this doesn't confirm any sort of timeline for the requested feature, it looks like players may have a new level of customization to look forward to in the future. The game already features a lot of ways for players to customize their characters and interact with one another, especially when it comes to including interactive emotes in Helldivers 2. Adding even more options would likely continue to win over players and keep the fanbase happy.\nHelldivers 2 May Soon Let Players Customize the Color of Their Armor\nIt's important to note that allowing players to recolor their armor would not be the same as a full transmog system. Shortly after release, the creative director stated the customization feature wouldn't make sense for Helldivers 2. Pilestedt believes the game's varied armors often look different because they serve different purposes, meaning a transmog system wouldn't fit the developer's vision.\nMany fans feel the option to recolor one's armor would be a welcome addition to the popular action game. Helldivers 2 recently increased its in-game store prices, which didn't go over well with some players. However, the ability to further customize armor might make those prices a little easier to swallow. While customizing colors isn't quite the full transmog system some players have been asking for, it would be a bit of a compromise on the part of Arrowhead.\n6 Images\nYour Rating\nRate Now\nLeave a Review\n8.6/10\nHelldivers 2\nDo you believe in freedom?

While Dragon Age: Origins introduced a modern take on the CRPG genre back in 2009, the series has since evolved in a completely different direction, favoring the combat system of BioWare's other big franchise – Mass Effect.

Never say never, I guess that’s what it comes down to.”\nBioWare Addresses the Possibility of a Dragon Age Remaster\nThere is another matter to consider. Unlike Mass Effect, the Dragon Age series was never quite as confident in its identity. Each subsequent sequel was a major departure from its predecessor, and though it worked well with the franchise's anthology format, it now makes the idea of creating a Dragon Age remastered collection a far more complicated affair. Not only are there technical hurdles to solve due to a lack of developers familiar with Eclipse, but porting the games over to Frostbite would likely necessitate changes to gameplay.\nBioWare confirmed that Dragon Age: The Veilguard would feature no DLCs and that the team is now committed to developing the next Mass Effect game. While Epler claims that BioWare has embraced its single-player roots after the player feedback on Anthem, he does point towards games such as Final Fantasy 14 as examples of how a multiplayer title can still tell a strong story.
