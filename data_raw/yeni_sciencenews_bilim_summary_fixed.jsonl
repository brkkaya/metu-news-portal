People seeking long-term addiction treatment who may have shied away from health care in the past because of stigma in a small town or lack of transportation can now receive substantive treatment.\nBut no one knows how long telehealth will remain a viable option for many people on Medicare. Policies introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic made it easier for people in rural America to access virtual care, but some of these programs are set to expire at the end of the year.\nRecent research suggests that expanded access to telehealth has an indispensable place in post-pandemic healthcare.

If a bill to extend these services isn’t passed before December 31, many people living in rural America will face renewed hurdles to accessible care.\nHealth care in rural areas can be hard to access\nPhysician shortages, hospital closures and the shuttering of critical services, such as labor and delivery care, have made it increasingly difficult to find reliable health care in rural areas (SN: 12/11/24). According to the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, almost 200 rural hospitals have closed since 2005, leaving millions of people without emergency care or inpatient services in their communities. Late insurance payments and tight profit margins have left 360 more rural hospitals at risk of immediate closure. As of this year, there are about 1,200 rural hospitals throughout the country.\nWhen these hospitals vanish, the patients they leave behind still fall ill and require care. People living in rural areas across the United States are more likely to die from heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease and stroke than their urban counterparts, researchers reported in May in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Sixty-five percent of nonmetropolitan counties across the country lack a psychiatrist, and rural patients have higher rates of suicide and depression than urban residents, other studies have found.\nIf you don’t get along with the only doctor in town, Martin says, you’re in a tough spot. “You’re left to the idiosyncrasies and vantage points of any small number of practitioners in that area. So if those practitioners aren’t interested in addiction, you won’t have addiction care. If they’re not interested in mental health, you won’t have mental health care.”\nUnsurprisingly, transportation to different providers is often a limiting factor for rural patients. For the millions of people living in rural parts of the country, it can take nearly twice as long to reach a hospital than it does for urban residents. Numbers vary wildly, but the average car travel time to the nearest hospital for someone in a rural area is 17 minutes; the average urban dweller needs just about 10 minutes. For people living in remote, hard-to-reach areas, it can take hours to reach in-person care.\nThere are patients who “literally have to take off an entire day of work to come and see us,” says U.S. Representative Gregory Murphy, a urologist who represents North Carolina’s 3rd District. “So many of the areas, sadly enough, in eastern North Carolina are rural and impoverished areas. So for people to lose half a day or a full day of work, it is a lot of lost wages.”\nTelehealth legislation has been a boon for rural residents\nIn March 2020, isolation, quarantine and fear of COVID-19 kept people away from health care centers. In response, Congress passed several temporary acts that expanded Medicare’s coverage of virtual care — for instance, patients could receive mental or behavioral telehealth care without visiting in-person after an initial appointment. Telehealth use boomed. In-person appointments shifted to virtual ones. The number of telehealth users has since dropped but remains higher than pre-pandemic levels.\nTelehealth takeoff\nTelehealth use among Medicare users skyrocketed during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, then dropped, according to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. But use remains nearly twice as high as it was before the pandemic.\nInitially set to expire at the end of the U.S. COVID-19 public health emergency in May 2023, the telehealth flexibilities were extended to December 31, 2024 (SN: 5/4/23). Some members of Congress want these expansions made permanent. Legislators have introduced several such bills this year, like the Telehealth Modernization Act of 2024. Despite pushback from insurance company lobbyists, expanded telehealth access “enjoys great bipartisan support,” says Murphy, who believes there is a “very good chance” the bill is added to Congress’ end-of-year package.\nIf the telehealth provisions aren’t extended, rural patients may soon find they have fewer options for health care.\n“This is going to harm a lot of folks,” says Andy Seaman, a harm reductionist and addiction medicine specialist based in Calais, Vt., where they are the head of Substance Use Disorder Programs at Better Life Partners. “I think it’s a huge barrier when you require people to come in person, especially for rural Americans.”\nSeaman treats many patients who are homeless and injecting methamphetamines or opioids. These patients might not have transportation, social support or available childcare, they say. Patients might be experiencing intimate partner violence, which can restrict their ability to attend in-person visits.\n“Telemedicine is critical for access,” Seaman says. Finding a primary care doctor, a specialist to help manage chronic conditions, and a mental health practitioner might be a tall order in some rural counties.\nAs the data roll in, scientists are learning that telehealth has the power to facilitate a diverse array of treatments. For example, doctors can virtually rehabilitate patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a lung disease with high prevalence in rural areas, and virtual mental health care can reduce depression symptoms and improve quality of life.\nAnd for patients with opioid use disorder, virtual care can actually boost treatment retention, researchers reported in the December Journal of Substance Use and Addiction Treatment. Patients will stay and seek care for longer when the barriers are fewer.\n“It is understandably very difficult for people to access relatively public resources like health care when they’re likely to know someone who works at their front desk or the nurse who’s helping them,” says Martin, who works at Boulder Care and the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School in Worcester, and virtually treats patients with opioid use disorder. “It’s very difficult to make yourself vulnerable to bias and prejudice because of an addiction. People told us over and over again, ‘I just couldn’t do this in my own town.’’’\nTelehealth isn’t a panacea for health care access\nWhile telehealth can be an incredible resource for mental health care, addiction treatment and chronic symptom management, it can’t address every health issue.\n“If you need someone to come in and … do screenings for diabetes and cancer and all of those things, they still need to happen in a clinical setting,” says Yendelela Cuffee, a social epidemiologist at the University of Delaware in Newark.\nBut she has seen more and more hospitals and federally qualified health centers close over the years. “There is a vast need to have those [facilities],” Cuffee says.\nAdditionally, many people living in rural America might lack the technology necessary to chat over video. In 2020, the Federal Communications Commission reported that about 22 percent of rural Americans and 28 percent of people on what the agency classifies as Tribal Lands lacked broadband coverage, which is internet access quick enough to accomplish basic web-browsing tasks.\nResearchers, policy makers and health care workers have also shared concerns about telehealth’s impact on the quality of care. Some argue that technical difficulties during the pandemic inhibited certain care routines. Others argue that communication is impacted due to loss of nonverbal cues from patients and clinicians.\nA growing number of studies are beginning to clarify how effective telehealth is when used to treat patients. For instance, the expansion of telehealth wasn’t associated with an increase or decrease in low-value care for Medicare patients in Michigan, researchers reported November 7 in JAMA Network Open. Low-value care encompasses services that are pricy, wasteful or even harmful to patients, like repeat lab tests or unnecessary prescriptions.\n“I think in general, policy makers are worried that because telehealth makes things more convenient, we might actually see more low-value care,” says Terrence Liu, a primary care physician and health services researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. His team’s finding “does provide some reassurance that we aren’t seeing a rise in low-value care when primary care practices use more telehealth.”\nThe next few weeks will determine how telehealth will integrate into post-pandemic health care. Researchers and physicians agree: Telehealth, while limited in ability, can bridge an increasingly large divide between rural patients and practitioners. For many patients, like those Martin and Seaman treat, telehealth can protect privacy, provide medication and pave the way for long-term recovery.\n“It’s not telehealth by itself.

In fact, in the surgery group, there was an 8.7 percent cumulative rate of invasive cancer, compared with a 3.1 percent rate in the monitoring group.\nOf cancers found in the monitoring group compared with those discovered during surgery, “those cancers weren’t any bigger, they weren’t any more likely to have spread, says Shelley Hwang, a breast cancer surgeon at Duke University School of Medicine.\nActive monitoring included mammograms every six months and hormone therapy for most participants. Of the 484 women in the monitoring group, 82 ended up having a lump or entire breast removed. The 473 participants assigned to the surgery group often also got radiation and hormone therapy. A handful of volunteers in each group got chemotherapy.\nThe results suggest that a watch-and-wait approach is safe in the short term and may even be superior to surgery for low-risk DCIS because it helps women avoid treatments for a precancerous condition that may never become life-threatening, Hwang and colleagues say.\nBut “two years of follow-up is way, way, way too short to draw that conclusion,” says Monica Morrow, a surgical oncologist and chief of breast cancer surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, who coauthored an editorial about the study that also appeared December 12 in JAMA. She points out that while women in the monitoring group who got delayed surgery didn’t have big statistical differences in the size of their tumors from the surgery group, the monitoring group had more cancers that were bigger than one centimeter than in the group that got surgery right away.\n“As cancers get bigger, the risk of spread to the women’s [lymph] nodes goes up. The amount of drug therapy we give to treat them increases,” Morrow says. “So, if by delaying surgery, you end up getting more aggressive treatment than you would have gotten if you had had the surgery in the beginning, is that really a good trade-off?”\nAnd the study isn’t representative of all women with DCIS, Morrow says.\nAs Hwang notes, the study examined DCIS in women age 40 and over in which abnormal duct cells “did not look particularly aggressive” and that have receptors for hormones such as estrogen or progesterone. Those factors make the cells low risk for becoming invasive cancer and controllable with hormone therapy. About half of the more than 50,000 cases of DCIS diagnosed in the United States each year fall into the low-risk category, Hwang says. People with more aggressive forms of DCIS shouldn’t wait to have it removed, she says.\nAnother difference between the women who volunteered for the study and the general population diagnosed with Stage 0 breast cancer is psychological, Morrow says. Often patients diagnosed with DCIS want it removed. But “women who went into this study very clearly wanted to have no surgery.” In fact, an unexpectedly large number of the 473 women randomly assigned to get surgery refused. Only 264 went ahead with their designated treatment.\nPatients and patient advocates who are worried about over-treatment may be reassured by the study, Hwang says. “Patients [diagnosed with DCIS] used to be told, ‘You need to be in the operating room next week so we can get this out.’ They can take a lot of reassurance in knowing that this is not an emergency, they don’t have to rush into anything.”", "date": "2024-12-12 00:00:00", "category": "Science", "question": "Stage 0 breast cancer patients may not need to rush to surgery\n\n\nWatch and wait may be an alternative to surgery for some women with a very early form of breast cancer.\nA new study of 957 women evaluated whether it was safe to do active monitoring of a low-risk form of ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS — a noninvasive cancer, often called Stage 0 breast cancer, that hasn’t spread beyond the milk ducts — as an alternative to surgery (SN: 8/30/24).\nAfter two years of follow-up, women who were assigned to get active monitoring had no more invasive breast cancer than women assigned to get surgery, researchers report December 12 in JAMA.

What now?\nWhile evidence grows for the harmful effects of social media on adolescent mental health, more rigorous research is needed to examine the mechanisms behind this potential causal link and why certain groups are more at risk of harm. Only then can policy makers, health professionals, parents and other adults help safeguard young people online (SN: 3/9/24, p. 14).\n3. Why the 2024 total solar eclipse will be such a big deal\nThe April 8 solar eclipse visible over North America was extraordinary, even by solar eclipse standards. The moon was at a point in its orbit that brought it quite close to Earth. The sun was also close to its peak activity, known as solar maximum. This confluence of factors gave spectators an especially dark and long eclipse and scientists an exciting opportunity to study the sun (SN: 3/9/24, p. 24).\n2. Geoscientists found the most dangerous part of a famous West Coast fault\nSeismic data reveal that the Cascadia megathrust, a massive fault in the Pacific Northwest, is not a single, continuous fracture, but rather composed of at least four segments. The most dangerous segment appears to stretch from off the coast of southern Vancouver Island through the state of Washington (SN: 7/13/24 & 7/27/24, p. 6).\n1.

A better understanding of psilocybin could lead to better mental health treatments (SN: 8/10/24, p. 12).\n4. Social media harms teens’ mental health, mounting evidence shows. What now?\nWhile evidence grows for the harmful effects of social media on adolescent mental health, more rigorous research is needed to examine the mechanisms behind this potential causal link and why certain groups are more at risk of harm. Only then can policy makers, health professionals, parents and other adults help safeguard young people online (SN: 3/9/24, p. 14).\n3. Why the 2024 total solar eclipse will be such a big deal\nThe April 8 solar eclipse visible over North America was extraordinary, even by solar eclipse standards. The moon was at a point in its orbit that brought it quite close to Earth. The sun was also close to its peak activity, known as solar maximum. This confluence of factors gave spectators an especially dark and long eclipse and scientists an exciting opportunity to study the sun (SN: 3/9/24, p. 24).\n2. Geoscientists found the most dangerous part of a famous West Coast fault\nSeismic data reveal that the Cascadia megathrust, a massive fault in the Pacific Northwest, is not a single, continuous fracture, but rather composed of at least four segments. The most dangerous segment appears to stretch from off the coast of southern Vancouver Island through the state of Washington (SN: 7/13/24 & 7/27/24, p. 6).\n1.

Scientists suspect that the squishy shapes are purposeful communications and hope to investigate whether wild belugas manipulate their melons too.\nFeathered flourishes\nPersian poems say that domestic parlor roller pigeons (Columba livia) do backflips on the ground because they’re happy — but the real reason comes down to their genes. A researcher has narrowed down the cause to 300 genes, with five confirmed to play a part in the bizarre behavior (SN: 4/20/24, p. 4). Meanwhile out in the wild, Japanese tits (Parus minor) flutter their wings to tell mates to enter the nest first, a type of gestural communication usually seen only in primates (SN: 4/20/24, p. 10).\nPlayful pets\nSay the name of your dog’s favorite toy, and she might be disappointed if you produce a different plaything instead. When shown an unexpected toy, pet dogs’ brains generate a signal that in humans indicates surprise, suggesting pooches may form mental images of objects (SN: 4/20/24, p. 11).

But a new analysis suggests something more must be changing at Earth’s center.\nThe most probable explanation is that the inner core is not only rotating differently — its surface is probably also morphing, geophysicist John Vidale of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles reported December 9 at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union.

So, researchers study it using seismic waves from earthquakes. Scientists typically use quakes that occur in the South Sandwich Islands near Antarctica, which repose on the opposite side of the planet from instrument arrays in Alaska.

Such twin temblors, known as doublets, should generate the same waveforms if their journeys through Earth were identical. But researchers have observed that some doublets in the South Sandwich Islands generate different waveforms in Alaska, indicating that something in the inner core had changed between the times the two quakes in those doublets occurred.\nIn 2023, geophysicists reported that the waveform differences stemmed from the inner core’s rotation slowing down so much that it appeared to have stopped moving — or even reversed — relative to the surface sometime around 2009 (SN: 1/23/23). Then, earlier this year, Vidale’s team seemingly confirmed the reversal.

The cleansing mixture removed eyeliner even more effectively: Ten wipes with the mixture removed nearly twice as much eyeliner as soap foam alone.\nThe polymer microbeads also absorbed copper ions from water, suggesting that unlike regular plastic microbeads, they could cleanse skin of metals encountered in certain types of dust (SN: 9/26/24).\nThis performance boost could drive more companies to adopt more sustainable materials in the future, says Ben Elling, a polymer chemist at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn. who was not involved in the study.\n“A lot of the fear of looking to more renewable or more degradable materials is that oftentimes they have worse properties than what you’re replacing,” Elling says. It’s easy to assume that there will always be a trade-off between performance and sustainability, he says, “but you can absolutely have the best of both worlds.”", "answer": "Scientists have developed a new, degradable microbead made from a poly(β-amino ester) polymer that can effectively remove skin stains, including permanent marker and eyeliner, without harming the environment. The microbead breaks down into harmless molecules, unlike traditional plastic microbeads, and can also absorb metal ions from water, making it a promising eco-friendly alternative for skin cleansers.", "validated": "Ok"}

{"title": "New COVID-19 booster shots have been approved. When should you get one?", "resource": "https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-covid-19-vaccine-fda-approved", "img_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/082224_ts_covid_feat.jpg", "body": "As the summer surge of COVID-19 crests, many people are weighing whether they need to get booster shots now to protect against the disease (SN: 7/19/24).\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved updated versions of mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna on August 22. The agency greenlit the shots for people 12 and older and gave emergency use authorization for children 6 months to 11 years old. Similar approval for Novavax’s latest version of its protein-based vaccine may soon follow.\nRollout of the new vaccines comes just before a program that temporarily paid for the shots for uninsured people expires at the end of August. That leaves about a week for people without insurance to decide whether to get a jab now at no cost.\n“If this is your opportunity to get the vaccine, and after that, you aren’t sure if you’re going to be able to pay for it, I would absolutely get the vaccine now,” says Kawsar Talaat, an infectious diseases physician at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\nHere’s what else to know about the new shots.\nHow are the updated vaccines different from last year’s version?\nThey’re the exact same vaccine save for one difference, Talaat says — the viral strain that’s targeted. Last year’s jabs were aimed at the omicron XBB.1.5 variant that caused the majority of cases in late winter 2022 and spring 2023.\nThe new mRNA boosters target the omicron KP.2 variant (also called JN.1.11.1.2), which accounted for an estimated 3.2 percent of cases in the United States from August 4 to 17. Two other omicron variants, KP.3 and KP3.1.1, together make up nearly 54 percent of cases during the same period. Another variant known as LB.1 caused 14 percent of cases. And there is an alphabet soup of other variants circulating, too.\nNovavax’s updated vaccine targets the JN.1 variant. That is the parent variant of KP.2, KP.3 and LB.1. The variants differ at only a few spots on their spike proteins, the knobby protein that the coronavirus uses to latch onto and enter cells. But the KP and LB.1 offspring may be a little bit more transmissible because those changes help the newer variants evade immunity from older versions of the vaccine and from infection with earlier coronavirus variants. It takes longer to reconfigure protein vaccines than it does for mRNA vaccines, so Novavax needed to go with the older version of the virus. In other countries, Moderna is making a JN.1 version of the vaccine, the company said in a statement.\nThis is the third time the vaccines have gotten updates to more closely match versions of the virus that are circulating. Each time the virus has been several steps ahead, but the shots have provided protection against severe disease, especially for older people and people with health conditions that put them at increased risk.\nInfectious diseases physician Carlos del Rio says he’d like to see high vaccination rates in everybody over 65 years old because those people are at higher risk for hospitalization and severe disease. “Vaccination continues to be one of our major strategies in [managing] COVID,” says del Rio, of Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. “And keeping immunity up is important.”\nWhen should I get the new COVID-19 booster?\nMaximum protection against the virus lasts for several months after getting boosted, Talaat says. So “even if you get the vaccine now, you’re likely to have some protection at Thanksgiving and Christmas.”\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends getting the shot at some point in September or October, depending on what works best for people, agency director Mandy Cohen said in an August 23 call with reporters. “The important part is getting it done.”\nPeople who were infected in this summer’s surge are probably still protected from repeat infections, Talaat says, and can wait until the fall to get their updated shot. While it’s hard to predict exactly how long the current surge will last, test positivity rates and waste water levels of the virus are still rising (SN: 9/20/23). “COVID is still killing lots of people,” she says. “We may not hear about it any longer, but it hasn’t gone away.”\nChildren returning to school could lead to a fresh round of infections. Just 14 percent of children ages 6 months to 17 years are up-to-date with the 2023–2024 COVID-19 booster, according to the CDC. And though more than 80 percent of adults 18 and over have received at least one shot, the number of people continuing to receive boosters has dropped steeply. Just 22 percent of people in this age group received a 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine dose, the CDC reported in data last updated in May.\nHow long does the shot’s protection last?\nMany scientists have investigated that question. One large study examining evidence of antibodies against the coronavirus found that by the fall of 2022 more than 96 percent of people in the United States had immunity from vaccination, prior infection or both.\nBut immunity can wane. For instance, last year, people who got the XBB.1.5 vaccine in Europe had pretty good protection against hospitalization from COVID-19 in the first month or so after getting the shot. The vaccines were about 69 percent effective 14 to 29 days after inoculation, researchers reported August 15 in Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses. Effectiveness dropped to 40 percent 60 to 105 days after vaccination. Part of the drop in effectiveness was because of the rise of the new JN.1 variants.\nBut protection doesn’t just fall off a cliff. New work offers evidence that the shots actually provide long-lasting benefits. Scientists performed an in-depth analysis of some 500 people’s immune responses over three years. Their results suggest that while the vaccine spurs an initial antibody boost that tends to fade rapidly, after a few months, antibody levels then stabilize, researchers reported in Immunity in March.\nUpdated versions of the vaccines may up that protection further. Pfizer submitted data to the FDA showing that its updated KP.2 version of the vaccine increased antibody production in mice and provided better protection against JN.1 and its offspring than last year’s version of the vaccine does.\nWill the booster protect against infection or long COVID?\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about these vaccines is that they prevent infection, del Rio says. A common refrain is: “Well, they don’t work because I still got COVID.” It’s true they’re not great at preventing infection, he says, but that doesn’t mean the vaccines aren’t working. “They’re very good at preventing severe disease and mortality.”\nIt’s still not clear if getting the vaccines will protect people from getting long COVID, del Rio says (SN: 7/17/24). Some data suggest yes, some suggest no. But, he says, “I think it’s a good idea to get vaccinated if you are worried.”\nTalaat doesn’t see any real downsides to getting the latest booster. “All vaccines have some side effects,” she says. People may see the same types of symptoms they experienced with previous versions of the vaccine. Those can include sore arms, headache, joint pain and fatigue. She points out that billions of vaccine doses have made it into the arms of people worldwide. “They’re very safe,” she says.\nEven if you’re young, healthy and at relatively low risk, Talaat still recommends getting boosted. “We need to do what we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones,” she says. Talaat plans to vaccinate her two teenagers “because their grandparents are in their 80s,” she says, “and I want to make sure that they stay safe as well.”\nAs for herself, Talaat says, “I’m seriously thinking about getting it next week.”\nErin Garcia de Jesús contributed to the reporting of this story.", "date": "2024-08-08 00:00:00", "category": "Science", "question": "New COVID-19 booster shots have been approved.

It’s true that engineering advances such as better motors and batteries, together with modern computing, mean that the required mechanical and electronic systems are no longer a barrier to advanced prostheses. But the field has struggled to integrate these powerful machines with the human body.\nThat’s starting to change. A recent trial tested one new integration technique, which involves surgically reconstructing muscle pairs that give recipients a sense of the position and movement of a bionic limb. Signals from those muscles control robotic joints, so the prosthesis is fully under control of the user’s brain. The system enabled people with below-knee amputations to walk more naturally and better navigate slopes, stairs and obstacles, researchers reported in the July Nature Medicine.\nEngineers have typically viewed biology as a fixed limitation to be engineered around, says bioengineer Tyler Clites, who helped develop the technique several years ago while at MIT. “But if we look at the body as part of the system to be engineered, in parallel with the machine, the two will be able to interact better.”\nThat view is driving a wave of techniques that reengineer the body to better integrate with the machine. Clites, now at UCLA, calls such techniques “anatomics,” to distinguish them from traditional bionics. “The issue we were tackling wasn’t an engineering problem,” he says. “The way the body had been manipulated during the amputation wasn’t leaving it in a position to be able to control the limbs we were creating.”\nIn an anatomics approach, bones are exploited to provide stable anchors; nerves are rerouted to create control signals for robotic limbs or transmit sensory feedback; muscles are co-opted as biological amplifiers or grafted into place to provide more signal sources. These techniques all improve the connection and communication between a robotic limb and the human nervous system, enhancing what bionic prostheses are capable of (SN: 2/9/24).\nAnatomics-based devices have been slow to make their way out of labs and into the commercial and clinical worlds. But some say the field is edging us closer to that sci-fi vision of seamlessly integrated, brain-controlled bionic limbs — especially as more advances lie around the corner.\nHere’s a closer look at how researchers are aiming to marry body and machine.\nReconstructing muscles\nProprioception — the body’s awareness of itself in space — is a tricky sense to restore, but it’s important for movement, especially walking (SN: 9/9/19). Muscles send signals to our brain about where our body is, how it is moving and what forces it encounters. These signals are generated mainly by coupled muscles called agonist-antagonist pairs, where one contracts as the other stretches.\nIn a traditional amputation, this important feedback is discarded. But the technique reported in the July study, known as an agonist-antagonist myoneural interface, or AMI, surgically reconstructs these push-pull pairs and uses the signals they generate to control prosthetic joints. The procedure enables a recipient to “feel” their prosthetic limb.\n“When the prosthesis moves, the person actually feels that movement as a natural proprioceptive sensation,” says MIT bionicist Hugh Herr, who developed the technique alongside Clites and the team’s surgeon Matthew Carty.\nThe recent study was part of a clinical trial that Herr and colleagues are conducting, which tested the technique in 14 people with below-the-knee amputation. Seven participants had undergone the AMI procedure, while the others had standard amputations. Recipients of the AMI-based system increased their walking speed by about 40 percent from 1.26 meters per second to 1.78 meters per second, the researchers found, a rate comparable to that of people without amputation.\nExtending bones\nThe most common complaints from prosthetic users involve pain and discomfort. A major source of discomfort is the attachment point.\n“Many of the problems with prosthetic usage are related to the socket,” says bioengineer Cindy Chestek of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Squishy flesh is poorly suited to transferring loads to the part of the body built for that job — bones. The resulting strain can cause tissue damage and, invariably, discomfort, sometimes leading users to abandon their device.\nA technique called osseointegration exploits the fact that certain metals bond with bone. A titanium bolt inserted into the skeleton anchors the prosthesis in place, providing greater strength, stability and comfort. “There’s a reason we have skeletons,” Chestek says.\nThe procedure was first carried out in 1990 but didn’t become widely accepted and clinically available until the past decade. One implant system, called OPRA, received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2020. The main drawback is that the titanium bolt must go through the skin, creating a permanent hole that carries infection risks. “Other than the infection risk, osseointegration is better in all ways,” Chestek says.\nRerouting nerves\nBionicists have long sought to tap into the body’s nerves to create prostheses that communicate with the brain. But early efforts were frustrating, mainly because the signals that nerves carry are very weak.\n“People tried for decades to get meaningful signals from [putting] a wire inside a nerve,” Chestek says. “To this day, it’s nearly impossible outside of a controlled lab setting.”\nModern bionic prostheses communicate mostly with muscles instead. When activated by a nerve, muscles emit much larger electrical signals, which can be picked up by electrodes on the skin, which then control the prosthetic limb.\nBut nerves that previously operated parts of a missing limb — and could similarly efficiently operate the artificial limb — don’t usually end in muscles. They go nowhere, which creates neuromas, bulbs at nerve ends whose electrical “sparking” causes pain.\nA procedure called targeted muscle reinnervation, or TMR, solves this problem. A surgeon strips muscles of their native nerves and reroutes severed nerves to this freshly cleared ground. Rerouted nerves grow into the muscles over time, which act as amplifiers, creating sources of the required control signals. “You turn a nerve recording problem into a muscle recording problem,” Chestek says. “Muscle recording is easy.” The procedure also treats neuroma pain — a purpose for which it is often carried out.\nA drawback is that TMR cannibalizes existing muscles, limiting the number of signals that can be created. “You run out of real estate pretty quickly,” Chestek says. This is especially important for amputations above the knee or elbow, where there are fewer remaining muscles and more prosthetic joints to control.\nA new technique, known as a regenerative peripheral nerve interface, or RPNI, surgically inserts small muscle grafts taken from elsewhere and reroutes nerves to these instead. Surgeons can then dissect these nerve bundles into their constituent fibers to capitalize on the newly grafted targets, allowing researchers to create as many signals as they need, Chestek says.\nThe small size of the muscle grafts makes it difficult to pick up signals from them using surface electrodes, though. “You can’t record [electrical signals] from a three-centimeter piece of muscle through the skin very easily,” Chestek says. “You have to use implanted electrodes.” This is more invasive, and implants face regulatory hurdles, but implanted electrodes produce higher quality signals. They just need to be accessed somehow, as running wires through the skin is not viable outside of laboratory studies.\nSome researchers are working on wireless systems, but another solution is to combine RPNIs with osseointegration. In this setup, wires between implanted electrodes and the prosthesis simply run through the titanium bolt. A study published last year described an above-the-elbow bionic arm using this approach that enabled the recipient to control every finger of his robotic hand.\nRebuilding bodies\nAt his UCLA anatomics lab, Clites says, “I’ve got nine or 10 active collaborations with surgeons on different projects.” Here, he and his team use cadavers to test ideas and gather data. “We’ll mount cadaver limbs to a manipulator arm and evaluate the systems we’re developing to make sure they work as intended,” Clites says. “It’s the backbone of what we do.”\nOne of the projects under development is a new attachment method that avoids the permanent hole that comes with osseointegration. Instead of a titanium bolt, there’s a piece of steel in the limb and an electromagnet in the socket of the prosthetic. “That magnet holds [the socket] onto the limb,” Clites says, “and then you can control how much attractive force there is by changing the current through that electromagnet.” The socket does not have to bear loads; the magnetic force does that job, changing from moment to moment according to requirements, such as walking versus standing.\nAt MIT, Herr is also working on a new advance. The recent trial of AMI-based bionic legs used electrodes on the skin to shepherd signals from muscles to the prosthetic joints. But surface electrodes have drawbacks, such as movement causing signal distortions. The new technique — called magnetomicrometry — involves placing magnetic spheres inside muscles and monitoring their movement with magnetometers. “With these magnets,” Herr says, “we can measure what we care about and use it to directly control the bionic prosthesis.” A commercial product will exist in about five years, he says.\nFor Herr, such advances are personal. Both of his legs were amputated below the knee after a mountain climbing accident 42 years ago. He is thinking of upgrading to AMI-based bionic leg prostheses in the coming years. Once these techniques are perfected, he predicts a leap forward. “When you marry surgical techniques like AMI and RPNI with something like magnetomicrometry, we believe it’s going to be game over,” Herr says. “We believe there’s going to be the Hollywood version of brain-controlled robotic limbs.”", "date": "2024-09-09 00:00:00", "category": "Science", "question": "Brain-controlled bionic limbs are inching closer to reality\n\n\nThe word “bionic” conjures sci-fi visions of humans enhanced to superhuman levels.

A study published last year described an above-the-elbow bionic arm using this approach that enabled the recipient to control every finger of his robotic hand.\nRebuilding bodies\nAt his UCLA anatomics lab, Clites says, “I’ve got nine or 10 active collaborations with surgeons on different projects.” Here, he and his team use cadavers to test ideas and gather data. “We’ll mount cadaver limbs to a manipulator arm and evaluate the systems we’re developing to make sure they work as intended,” Clites says. “It’s the backbone of what we do.”\nOne of the projects under development is a new attachment method that avoids the permanent hole that comes with osseointegration. Instead of a titanium bolt, there’s a piece of steel in the limb and an electromagnet in the socket of the prosthetic. “That magnet holds [the socket] onto the limb,” Clites says, “and then you can control how much attractive force there is by changing the current through that electromagnet.” The socket does not have to bear loads; the magnetic force does that job, changing from moment to moment according to requirements, such as walking versus standing.\nAt MIT, Herr is also working on a new advance. The recent trial of AMI-based bionic legs used electrodes on the skin to shepherd signals from muscles to the prosthetic joints. But surface electrodes have drawbacks, such as movement causing signal distortions. The new technique — called magnetomicrometry — involves placing magnetic spheres inside muscles and monitoring their movement with magnetometers. “With these magnets,” Herr says, “we can measure what we care about and use it to directly control the bionic prosthesis.” A commercial product will exist in about five years, he says.\nFor Herr, such advances are personal. Both of his legs were amputated below the knee after a mountain climbing accident 42 years ago. He is thinking of upgrading to AMI-based bionic leg prostheses in the coming years. Once these techniques are perfected, he predicts a leap forward. “When you marry surgical techniques like AMI and RPNI with something like magnetomicrometry, we believe it’s going to be game over,” Herr says. “We believe there’s going to be the Hollywood version of brain-controlled robotic limbs.”", "answer": "Researchers are making progress in developing brain-controlled bionic limbs by integrating the mechanical and electronic systems with the human body. A recent trial tested a technique that involves surgically reconstructing muscle pairs to control robotic joints, allowing people with below-knee amputations to walk more naturally. Other techniques, such as osseointegration and targeted muscle reinnervation, are also being developed to improve the connection and communication between a robotic limb and the human nervous system. These advances are bringing us closer to the sci-fi vision of seamlessly integrated, brain-controlled bionic limbs.", "validated": "Ok"}

The technology is a step toward prosthetic limbs that restore a full range of senses, improving both their usefulness and acceptance by those who wear them.\nA team of researchers in Italy and Switzerland attached the device, called ”MiniTouch,” to the prosthetic hand of a 57-year-old man named Fabrizio, who has an above-the-wrist amputation. In tests, the man could identify cold, cool and hot bottles of liquid with perfect accuracy; tell the difference between plastic, glass and copper significantly better than chance; and sort steel blocks by temperature with around 75 percent accuracy, researchers report February 9 in Med.\n“It’s important to incorporate these technologies in a way that prosthesis users can actually use to perform functional tasks,” says neuroengineer Luke Osborn of Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., who was not involved in the study. “Introducing new sensory feedback modalities could help give users more functionality they weren’t able to achieve before.”\nThe device also improved Fabrizio’s ability to tell whether he was touching an artificial or human arm. His accuracy was 80 percent with the device turned on, compared with 60 percent with it off. “It’s not quite as good as with the intact hand, probably because we’re not giving [information about] skin textures,” says neuroengineer Solaiman Shokur of EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.\nWork to restore a sense of touch to prosthetic limbs has advanced greatly over the past decade (SN: 9/9/19). But the ability to detect temperature has lagged behind. “Temperature is almost the last modality that needs to be solved in order to then put all the results together and be able to make an artificial limb really feel as the biological one,” says EPFL engineer Jonathan Muheim.\nThe study builds on work the group published last May, which found that people who have had amputations often have spots on their residual limbs that, when heated or cooled, generate temperature sensations in their missing hand. It’s caused by stimulating nerves originally destined for the missing hand. The researchers showed they could reliably elicit phantom temperature sensations over time in 63 percent of amputees.\nIn the new study, Shokur, Muheim and colleagues first mapped Fabrizio’s phantom temperature sensations to match a spot on his arm to the corresponding sensation in the index finger of his missing hand. They then attached a temperature sensor to the fingertip of his prosthetic hand, which was connected via a controller unit to a device on Fabrizio’s arm that delivered appropriate temperature signals.\nCurrently the device employs only one sensor at the end of the index finger, but the team plans to add sensor-stimulator pairs to create more temperature-sensitive locations on the prosthetic hand. They are also planning to develop a prosthesis that combines the ability to sense touch as well as temperature. “In the coming year or so, hopefully that’s where we’ll be,” says Shokur.\nThe speed at which the device relays temperature may become an issue when combining multiple senses. Osborn and colleagues have developed a device as thin as a Band-Aid that delivers realistic cooling sensations nearly as quickly as natural responses, that team reported in Nature Biomedical Engineering last July.\nIn the immediate term, the new device needs to be tested in larger groups of participants, as well as real world settings, to ensure it isn’t adversely affected by high air temperatures or humidity. “We still need to do those crash tests outside the lab,” says Shokur.\nOnce it leaves the lab, Fabrizio already knows how he’d put it to use. “With these new technologies, I can understand better what I am touching,” Fabrizio said in a prerecorded video interview. “Certainly, my priority would be to use it in a kitchen to cook.”", "date": "2024-02-02 00:00:00", "category": "Science", "question": "A new device let a man sense temperature with his prosthetic hand\n\n\nA new device makes it possible for a person with an amputation to sense temperature with a prosthetic hand.

But astronomers now know where they’re going. New observations, reported in the Nov. 1 Astrophysical Journal Letters, capture the 3-D structure and motion of debris left in the wake of a supernova that was seen to detonate almost 900 years ago.\n“It’s a piece of the puzzle towards understanding this very bizarre [supernova] remnant,” says astronomer Tim Cunningham of the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.\nThe supernova was first recorded in 1181 as a “guest star” by astronomers in ancient China and Japan (SN: 4/17/02). Astronomers didn’t find the remains of that explosion, now called the Pa 30 nebula, until 2013.\nAnd when they did find the remnant, it looked weird. The supernova appeared to be a kind called type 1a, wherein a white dwarf star detonates, destroying itself in the process (SN: 3/23/16). But in this case, part of the star survived.\nStranger still, the star was surrounded by spiky filaments stretching about three light-years from the star in all directions. “This is really unique,” Cunningham says. “There’s no other supernova nebula that shows filaments like this.”\nHe and colleagues used a telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to record how fast the filaments are moving relative to Earth. Then they built a 3-D reconstruction of the filaments and their motions through space.\nThe team found that the system is structured “kind of like a three-layered onion,” Cunningham says. The inner layer is the star. Then there’s a gap of one or two light-years, which ends in a spherical shell of dust. The final layer is the filaments, which emerge from the dust shell.\nResearchers still aren’t sure how the filaments formed, or how they’ve maintained their straight-line shapes for centuries. One possibility is that a shock wave from the explosion ricocheted off the diffuse material between stars and bounced back toward the white dwarf.

But astronomers now know where they’re going. New observations, reported in the Nov. 1 Astrophysical Journal Letters, capture the 3-D structure and motion of debris left in the wake of a supernova that was seen to detonate almost 900 years ago.\n“It’s a piece of the puzzle towards understanding this very bizarre [supernova] remnant,” says astronomer Tim Cunningham of the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.\nThe supernova was first recorded in 1181 as a “guest star” by astronomers in ancient China and Japan (SN: 4/17/02). Astronomers didn’t find the remains of that explosion, now called the Pa 30 nebula, until 2013.\nAnd when they did find the remnant, it looked weird. The supernova appeared to be a kind called type 1a, wherein a white dwarf star detonates, destroying itself in the process (SN: 3/23/16). But in this case, part of the star survived.\nStranger still, the star was surrounded by spiky filaments stretching about three light-years from the star in all directions. “This is really unique,” Cunningham says. “There’s no other supernova nebula that shows filaments like this.”\nHe and colleagues used a telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to record how fast the filaments are moving relative to Earth. Then they built a 3-D reconstruction of the filaments and their motions through space.\nThe team found that the system is structured “kind of like a three-layered onion,” Cunningham says. The inner layer is the star. Then there’s a gap of one or two light-years, which ends in a spherical shell of dust. The final layer is the filaments, which emerge from the dust shell.\nResearchers still aren’t sure how the filaments formed, or how they’ve maintained their straight-line shapes for centuries. One possibility is that a shock wave from the explosion ricocheted off the diffuse material between stars and bounced back toward the white dwarf. That wave could have sculpted the material into the spikes astronomers see. Future theoretical studies using the new observations might help solve the puzzle.\nThe study did show that this remnant is almost definitely from the guest star of 1181.

Cloutier, now of Abbott Laboratories in Abbott Park, Ill., and Jonathan Widom of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.\nThe short DNA pieces in those tests bent to a radius of curvature of 5 nm. Their bends were as tight as those that occur when DNA entwines with proteins in cells.

They pointed out an error in the experimental procedure. Widom and his colleagues are now repeating the experiment with a revised protocol. In the results so far, DNA looping is still 100 times as prevalent as had been originally expected, Widom told Science News.\nHowever, when Vologodskii’s team performed the test, the researchers reported no excess loops.\nDespite the disagreement over the results of that experiment, it inspired further tests on the bendability of DNA. Wiggins and his colleagues at five universities in the United States and the Netherlands next took a different tack.

Collins. He’s remembering the tense 1956 civil rights bus boycott in Tallahassee, Fla. As soon as young Herbert had wriggled to a safer spot on the floor of the car, his mom would stomp the gas pedal and hope to outrun the police once again.\nCollins, on her morning drives to Herbert’s school and then on to her university faculty job, was giving rides to people boycotting the city’s racially segregated public buses. Tallahassee’s seven-month boycott isn’t as famous as the one in Montgomery, Ala., which started in late 1955, but the Tallahassee boycott also stirred fierce white pushback. The legal system made an example of 21 other local activists offering rides, charging them with running a profitable city transportation system without getting a franchise from the city to do so. The targeted activists were each fined $500 and, if caught in illegal activity during the next year, would spend 60 days in jail.\nHerbert still remembers crouching in the car, watching his mother’s foot on the gas. “I was like, ‘You’re going to make a hole in the floor if you press it much harder,’ ” he says. They never caught her though.\n“I think her life would make a great movie,” says entomologist Jessica Ware of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.\nIn her science, Collins specialized in termites, studying some of the specimens that are now under Ware’s care at the museum. Though these insects are perhaps best known for the damage they can do to human-built structures, Collins’ interest was not in the service of pest control. Instead, she studied the vast, odd universe of termite diversity, glorying in the variations among the world’s 2,000-plus species. Many of these species are not much more likely than a human to eat soggy porch steps.\nThough she started by studying termite resistance to dehydration in the lab, Collins in time established herself as a skilled field biologist. She explored in at least 10 countries outside the United States and was recognized as an authority on termites of the Caribbean. Both Collins and Ware, a generation apart, made expeditions into Guyana’s rainforests, rich in insects of interest to science but also in snakes, prowling jaguars and other excitements. Field biology is not for the faint-hearted.\nToday, Collins also gets recognized for overcoming the many frictions that came with working in the largely white male world of U.S. midcentury biology. Her doctoral dissertation, completed in 1949, made Collins “only the third Black woman zoologist in the country,” at least with a Ph.D., writes science historian Wini Warren in Black Women Scientists in the United States. And that would make Collins America’s first Black female entomologist to earn such an advanced degree.\nCaptivated by termites\nCollins’ childhood shared some details with the life of mathematician Katherine Johnson (SN: 5/25/21), portrayed in the beloved 2016 book and movie Hidden Figures, about Black women at NASA who performed key calculations for early space flight (SN: 12/23/16). Both Johnson and Margaret James Strickland Collins (her name reflecting two marriages) grew up in West Virginia. Both women skipped grades, went early to the same high school and then the same college.\nBorn Margaret James in 1922 as the lively, precocious fourth of five children, Collins grew up in the college town of Institute, W.Va., finding plenty of countryside to explore nature. Her superpower was not exotic math but reading. She learned just by sitting on the lap of whichever parent did the nightly story time. At age 6, Collins was allowed to borrow any book she could reach in the library of West Virginia State College, a historically Black institution.\nHer father, Rollins James, taught agriculture there. He had worked with crop pioneer George Washington Carver and had a master’s degree from Tuskegee Institute. Her mother, Luella, had wanted to become an archaeologist, Collins told Warren during an interview. Luella was a passionate reader, “independent,” even “rebellious,” Collins said.\nCollins could certainly question authority. Herbert, the son who crouched on the car floor, remembers her saying about childhood Christmas merriment: “My parents actually tried to make me think that a reindeer could fly through the air.” Having seen a picture of a reindeer, “I knew there’s just no way this reindeer could fly.”\nBoth math prodigy Johnson, born in 1918, and reindeer-skeptic Collins went to West Virginia State College, now West Virginia State University.\nCollins had planned to major in biology, but lessons she described to Warren as “stereotyped, dull and malodorous” and a “gruff and frightening” teacher sapped her interest. She lost her scholarship. Still, summers working kept her in college long enough to encounter a biology professor who helped her ID a water creature she’d discovered in a stream, thereby renewing her interest. Then came World War II.\nThese were uncertain times. In July 1942, she married Bernard Strickland, a premed student at Howard University in Washington, D.C. Within months, though, he was drafted for military service.\nAfter finishing her undergraduate degree the next year, with a major in biology and minors in physics and German, she headed to the University of Chicago. Though the state of West Virginia had a publicly sponsored graduate school, it had only started admitting Black students in 1940 (with the whopping total of three, including Katherine Johnson).\nCollins received a $125 stipend from the state, she later told biographer Warren, but it wouldn’t go very far. To help fund grad school, she worked a night shift at a ball bearing factory. After rent and other expenses, she could afford only 10 meals a week — and she was often exhausted.\nBut it was there that her life took on a new direction. In a chance conversation at class registration, she met American biologist and termite maestro Alfred Emerson. Emerson was “a true giant in termite research,” says Nan-Yao Su, a specialist in termites and one of Collins’ later collaborators, now at the University of Florida’s Fort Lauderdale Research and Education Center.\nCollins was captivated by the course she took with Emerson. He heard of her financial pinch and offered an assistantship that included looking after the termite collection. This began her lifelong fascination.\nTermites rank among nature’s star soil engineers in many tropical and subtropical ecosystems. Plus, like bees and ants, they can create complex societies with specialized castes and, in some species, weird body parts. Among the Nasutitermes species Collins studied, some termite soldiers defend themselves by squirting sticky glop from their heads through a glue gun structure “like a less-floppy elephant nose,” Ware says.\nCollins’ Ph.D. thesis turned into her first publication on termite tolerance for water loss, which appeared in 1950 in Ecology. Of three species collected in the Chicago area, she found that the one that also ranged widely across the more arid West could survive longer in drier air. The thickness of a waxy outer layer played a role but didn’t explain all the differences in the species’ ranges.\nThis was one small bit of data for what are giant questions about biodiversity. How can kin eventually become so diverse? And how does evolution create the wild patchwork of species covering the planet? With so many forms around the world, termites are great for exploring these questions.\nThough Emerson supported her Ph.D. work, he had his prejudices too. He refused to let Collins join an expedition documenting plants and animals in the Pacific’s Marshall Islands after the war. His objections were just “good ole boy stuff,” sniffs Vernard Lewis, a termite entomologist at the University of California, Berkeley and a Collins biographer. “The field was supposed to be dangerous and adventurous,” and thus not for women back then, Lewis says.\nA civil rights activist\nWith World War II over, Collins’ husband returned to medical school at Howard University. She found an instructor job there in 1947 and joined him. To finish her Ph.D., she would now have to squeeze in remote work and some summers in Chicago. Though her marriage dissolved in 1949, she also finished her Ph.D. that year.\nHer new degree won her a promotion to assistant professor at Howard, but she wasn’t hopeful for future prospects. “They refused to promote me because they said I was too young. But it was also because I was a woman,” she later told Warren. Also Collins chafed at the department’s majority focus on medically useful research.\nIn 1951, Collins accepted a teaching position at what became Florida A&M University, like Howard, one of the country’s historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs. “The white institutions wouldn’t hire her, so she went back to the HBCUs,” Lewis says. This put her in Tallahassee as civil rights issues were intensifying. Also in 1951, she remarried, taking the name Margaret S. Collins that would be on publications for the rest of her life.\nIn Florida she could run her own field expeditions looking for termites with help from her husband, Herbert L. Collins. By 1958, she had collected and tested termites’ ability for what she called “water relations” in nine of the 13 termite species known in Florida, including those from the Everglades and the Florida Keys. Over years, Collins explored how some termite species — without the extra-hardened outer armor of ants or beetles — avoid drying to a crisp in a desert while others need steaming rainforests. Evolutionary biologist Barbara Thorne of the University of Maryland in College Park points to the long string of papers on water relations as a highlight of Collins’ research.\nEventually, there would be research trips that included Herbert Jr. and then his younger brother James as field assistants. Collecting termites is a vigorous business, and a big machete was part of their mom’s field gear. “That’s a famous machete,” Lewis says. Herbert Jr. saved it.\nBut life was not easy. Moving to Tallahassee in the 1950s era of activism exposed the Collins family to toxic racism. Herbert Jr. remembers his mother planning to give a science talk on termites at a traditionally white school, Florida State University. But a phone caller threatened to blow up the science building if a Black speaker dared to lecture there. According to Warren, Collins then searched the building herself and found no bomb. She also found an alternative location for the talk.\nDuring the Tallahassee bus boycott, Collins ended up doing one special midnight drive that “terrified” her, Warren reports. The civil rights group that had called for the boycott got a tip that the police and FBI were about to raid its headquarters. Collins spirited away the membership records with names, addresses and activities.\nThe family farmhouse also came under threat from violent racists. As the story goes, Collins, despite her other responsibilities, spent nights on the porch with a shotgun. She guarded the house, Herbert Jr. confirms, but not alone.\n“We had a rocker and a sofa out there, and when the threats were high, we would sleep out there,” Herbert Jr. remembers. Each parent had a gun. “For a little kid, it was kind of exciting,” he says. The family told jokes, talked about “little things,” at least until the children fell asleep. The dangers of the time were real, but only the mailbox got damaged.\nMargaret and Herbert Collins divorced in 1963. She left Florida A&M to return to Howard University in 1964 as a full professor. She juggled the needs of her students, her science and her sons while working at Howard and at Federal City College (now the University of the District of Columbia) as well as traveling for research.\nThe question of how termites got by with very little water, including in the Sonoran Desert, continued to intrigue her. She worked through species after species. Overall, water, scarce or abundant, and heat are the two main factors shaping where particular termites live, Collins wrote in her chapter in the 1969 two-volume, multi-author opus Biology of Termites.\nAn energetic seeker of grants and collaborations, she traveled in the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America to explore for termites. From the late 1970s, she held (volunteer) research associate status at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and worked on its termite collection, which now includes several dozen of her own specimens.\n“In many ways, she was just an enthusiastic person,” says Thorne, who was a co-adventurer and coauthor with Collins. “The museum stuff, the lectures, the teaching, whatever — she loved all that. But she was at her best in the field.”\nMargaret Collins, the ‘termite lady’\nAmong the termite marvels that lured Collins into the tropics was that glue-blasting “less-floppy elephant nose” (as Ware described it). This defense mechanism appeared to have evolved twice. Soldiers belonging to species of Nasutitermes and Subulitermes can do it, yet those species sprouted from rather different branches of the termites’ evolutionary tree. “Parallel evolution” is what Emerson and other scientists had called the phenomenon of not-so-related look-alikes.\nCollins worked with biochemist Glenn Prestwich to question the notion. Delving into the unusual compounds in the glue convinced them that the cocktails are both so odd and similar that it’s too improbable they arose independently. “We were surprised,” Prestwich and Collins reported in 1981 in Biochemical Systematics and Ecology.\nThe best sense of what Collins faced as she did all this termite exploring may come from her own words on a pdf of three aged, typewritten pages she had sent colleagues about a mishap in Colombia’s Amazon rainforest. Titled “Me and My Maggot or My Duel with Dermatobia hominis,” the account features a parasitic fly larva that burrows into living flesh and grows spines.\n“The whole sorry episode” as Collins puts it, starts one August day as she’s sitting outside a small motel in Colombia that served as headquarters for sampling Amazon insect life. A “sharp-stinging sensation” in her ankle prompts “a feeling of foreboding.” Sure enough, in coming days, the spot swells into a stabbing-painful, oozing “volcano shaped” lump.\nWhen Collins gets home to the United States, she tries several home remedies, some a bit helpful. She’s slammed by work: a U.S. collecting trip, a commitment on a research project, plus she’s “deeply involved in catching up on school responsibilities.” Then while teaching, she’s hit by “pains so severe as to render speech impossible and decorum doubtful.”\nShe excuses herself from “a polite but wondering class” to search for an ice pack. The closest options are cans of frozen orange juice concentrate, which at least let her set up a movie to show her class while she waits for the end. After phoning experts and checking her parasitology references, she goes to an emergency room. A doctor cuts into the inflamed tissue and finds — nothing.\nIn the end Collins solved the problem herself. She coated the area with thick ointment, and the larva wriggled up to the skin surface. Nabbing it with forceps didn’t work, so “I squeezed and squeezed and SQUEEZED until out it popped!” she wrote. She then preserved the larva as a scientific specimen.\nFieldwork is a mix of wonder and alarm in Ware’s stories as well. On a recent expedition in Guyana, Ware and her students got a strong reminder of the need for vigilance: a big caiman swimming fast upstream. In another instance, students collecting insects at night heard a jaguarish growl off in the dark. Still dengue-carrying mosquitoes, no bigger than dandelion fluff, might have been the scariest.\nWare never met Collins, who passed away in 1996 on a research trip to the Cayman Islands. The last time Herbert Jr. saw her alive was at an airport near Washington, D.C., where she’d collected an insect she found interesting in an airport ladies’ room.\nCollins’ breakthrough into the largely male club of field biologists, her overpacked years as a single parent, along with her competition for funds amid entrenched sexism and overt racism, make the “termite lady,” as she came to be called, an inspiring figure today. Her portrait hangs in Ware’s office.", "date": "2024-11-11 00:00:00", "category": "Science", "question": "This ‘hidden figure’ of entomology fought for civil rights\n\n\nOn the drive to school, at the first sign of trouble, “she made me get on the floorboard,” says the older son of pioneering Black entomologist Margaret S. Collins. He’s remembering the tense 1956 civil rights bus boycott in Tallahassee, Fla. As soon as young Herbert had wriggled to a safer spot on the floor of the car, his mom would stomp the gas pedal and hope to outrun the police once again.\nCollins, on her morning drives to Herbert’s school and then on to her university faculty job, was giving rides to people boycotting the city’s racially segregated public buses. Tallahassee’s seven-month boycott isn’t as famous as the one in Montgomery, Ala., which started in late 1955, but the Tallahassee boycott also stirred fierce white pushback. The legal system made an example of 21 other local activists offering rides, charging them with running a profitable city transportation system without getting a franchise from the city to do so. The targeted activists were each fined $500 and, if caught in illegal activity during the next year, would spend 60 days in jail.\nHerbert still remembers crouching in the car, watching his mother’s foot on the gas. “I was like, ‘You’re going to make a hole in the floor if you press it much harder,’ ” he says. They never caught her though.\n“I think her life would make a great movie,” says entomologist Jessica Ware of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.\nIn her science, Collins specialized in termites, studying some of the specimens that are now under Ware’s care at the museum. Though these insects are perhaps best known for the damage they can do to human-built structures, Collins’ interest was not in the service of pest control. Instead, she studied the vast, odd universe of termite diversity, glorying in the variations among the world’s 2,000-plus species. Many of these species are not much more likely than a human to eat soggy porch steps.\nThough she started by studying termite resistance to dehydration in the lab, Collins in time established herself as a skilled field biologist. She explored in at least 10 countries outside the United States and was recognized as an authority on termites of the Caribbean. Both Collins and Ware, a generation apart, made expeditions into Guyana’s rainforests, rich in insects of interest to science but also in snakes, prowling jaguars and other excitements. Field biology is not for the faint-hearted.\nToday, Collins also gets recognized for overcoming the many frictions that came with working in the largely white male world of U.S. midcentury biology. Her doctoral dissertation, completed in 1949, made Collins “only the third Black woman zoologist in the country,” at least with a Ph.D., writes science historian Wini Warren in Black Women Scientists in the United States. And that would make Collins America’s first Black female entomologist to earn such an advanced degree.\nCaptivated by termites\nCollins’ childhood shared some details with the life of mathematician Katherine Johnson (SN: 5/25/21), portrayed in the beloved 2016 book and movie Hidden Figures, about Black women at NASA who performed key calculations for early space flight (SN: 12/23/16). Both Johnson and Margaret James Strickland Collins (her name reflecting two marriages) grew up in West Virginia. Both women skipped grades, went early to the same high school and then the same college.\nBorn Margaret James in 1922 as the lively, precocious fourth of five children, Collins grew up in the college town of Institute, W.Va., finding plenty of countryside to explore nature. Her superpower was not exotic math but reading. She learned just by sitting on the lap of whichever parent did the nightly story time. At age 6, Collins was allowed to borrow any book she could reach in the library of West Virginia State College, a historically Black institution.\nHer father, Rollins James, taught agriculture there. He had worked with crop pioneer George Washington Carver and had a master’s degree from Tuskegee Institute. Her mother, Luella, had wanted to become an archaeologist, Collins told Warren during an interview. Luella was a passionate reader, “independent,” even “rebellious,” Collins said.\nCollins could certainly question authority. Herbert, the son who crouched on the car floor, remembers her saying about childhood Christmas merriment: “My parents actually tried to make me think that a reindeer could fly through the air.” Having seen a picture of a reindeer, “I knew there’s just no way this reindeer could fly.”\nBoth math prodigy Johnson, born in 1918, and reindeer-skeptic Collins went to West Virginia State College, now West Virginia State University.\nCollins had planned to major in biology, but lessons she described to Warren as “stereotyped, dull and malodorous” and a “gruff and frightening” teacher sapped her interest. She lost her scholarship. Still, summers working kept her in college long enough to encounter a biology professor who helped her ID a water creature she’d discovered in a stream, thereby renewing her interest. Then came World War II.\nThese were uncertain times. In July 1942, she married Bernard Strickland, a premed student at Howard University in Washington, D.C. Within months, though, he was drafted for military service.\nAfter finishing her undergraduate degree the next year, with a major in biology and minors in physics and German, she headed to the University of Chicago. Though the state of West Virginia had a publicly sponsored graduate school, it had only started admitting Black students in 1940 (with the whopping total of three, including Katherine Johnson).\nCollins received a $125 stipend from the state, she later told biographer Warren, but it wouldn’t go very far. To help fund grad school, she worked a night shift at a ball bearing factory. After rent and other expenses, she could afford only 10 meals a week — and she was often exhausted.\nBut it was there that her life took on a new direction. In a chance conversation at class registration, she met American biologist and termite maestro Alfred Emerson. Emerson was “a true giant in termite research,” says Nan-Yao Su, a specialist in termites and one of Collins’ later collaborators, now at the University of Florida’s Fort Lauderdale Research and Education Center.\nCollins was captivated by the course she took with Emerson. He heard of her financial pinch and offered an assistantship that included looking after the termite collection. This began her lifelong fascination.\nTermites rank among nature’s star soil engineers in many tropical and subtropical ecosystems. Plus, like bees and ants, they can create complex societies with specialized castes and, in some species, weird body parts. Among the Nasutitermes species Collins studied, some termite soldiers defend themselves by squirting sticky glop from their heads through a glue gun structure “like a less-floppy elephant nose,” Ware says.\nCollins’ Ph.D. thesis turned into her first publication on termite tolerance for water loss, which appeared in 1950 in Ecology. Of three species collected in the Chicago area, she found that the one that also ranged widely across the more arid West could survive longer in drier air. The thickness of a waxy outer layer played a role but didn’t explain all the differences in the species’ ranges.\nThis was one small bit of data for what are giant questions about biodiversity. How can kin eventually become so diverse? And how does evolution create the wild patchwork of species covering the planet? With so many forms around the world, termites are great for exploring these questions.\nThough Emerson supported her Ph.D. work, he had his prejudices too. He refused to let Collins join an expedition documenting plants and animals in the Pacific’s Marshall Islands after the war. His objections were just “good ole boy stuff,” sniffs Vernard Lewis, a termite entomologist at the University of California, Berkeley and a Collins biographer. “The field was supposed to be dangerous and adventurous,” and thus not for women back then, Lewis says.\nA civil rights activist\nWith World War II over, Collins’ husband returned to medical school at Howard University. She found an instructor job there in 1947 and joined him. To finish her Ph.D., she would now have to squeeze in remote work and some summers in Chicago. Though her marriage dissolved in 1949, she also finished her Ph.D. that year.\nHer new degree won her a promotion to assistant professor at Howard, but she wasn’t hopeful for future prospects. “They refused to promote me because they said I was too young. But it was also because I was a woman,” she later told Warren. Also Collins chafed at the department’s majority focus on medically useful research.\nIn 1951, Collins accepted a teaching position at what became Florida A&M University, like Howard, one of the country’s historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs. “The white institutions wouldn’t hire her, so she went back to the HBCUs,” Lewis says.

It’s also prudent, he and colleague Maria Albo reported in the May Biology Letters. Sometimes female Pisaura mirabilis spiders just eat males that come calling. In a lab test, however, suitors bearing gifts were almost one-third as likely to be devoured as males that showed up empty-legged.\nMales of diverse animal species go wooing with gifts of food or showy things. Biologists have long discussed the evolution of these nuptial gifts, including the possible benefits for male self-defense.\nA different lab’s experiment with nursery web spiders had failed to find a defensive benefit because so few courtships in this species end in death.

Two organisms meet over a barrel of alcohol and decide to mate.\nGeneticist Maitreya Dunham didn’t see it happen. But she has molecular evidence that two yeast species produced a hybrid in an old warehouse turned microbrewery. The two species had grown apart, evolutionarily speaking, about 10 million to 20 million years ago, Dunham, of the University of Washington in Seattle, and colleagues calculate. Yet the distant relatives interbred, producing the hybrid that ended up in a barrel of wild beer.\nBut wait a minute, some people may adamantly argue: Separate species can’t mate and reproduce. Much of the time, those hybrid deniers are right. But hybrids do happen, far more often than scientists used to think, says Molly Schumer, an evolutionary geneticist at Harvard University. Plants are famous cross-species breeders. Yeasts do it all the time, especially in the nutrient-rich microbe “meet market” that is a brewery, Dunham says. “It’s like a yeast hookup zone.”\nResearchers have discovered fish, birds, mice, fruit flies and other animals in the wild carrying DNA from parents of different species. Perhaps the biggest shocker of all was the 2010 discovery that humans had interbred with Neandertals after leaving Africa. Humans still carry genetic souvenirs of the encounters (SN: 6/5/10, p. 5). These discoveries would seem to contradict the biological species concept, which holds that separate species can’t mate and produce fertile offspring.\nBut the blurred lines between species don’t bother many researchers, says evolutionary biologist Glenn-Peter Sætre of the University of Oslo. He and others are learning from that blurry zone, the place where hybrids thrive or sometimes fail. Finding out why some hybrids make it and others don’t may yield molecular details about how reproductive barriers between species are built, says evolutionary population geneticist Graham Coop of the University of California, Davis. Studying fully reproductively separated species is no good; their barriers are well established, and it’s difficult to know which bricks were laid first. With hybrids, researchers can watch the barriers being erected, Coop and others say. Those studies give researchers insight into the process of speciation, the separation of a population into different species.\nMingling fish\nThe swordtail fish Xiphophorus nezahualcoyotl inhabits certain rivers in Mexico (green shows range). The species is a hybrid of X. montezumae (blue) and X. cortezi (red), found in different rivers. The interbreeding between those species probably took place more than 2,500 generations ago, though swordtails in other rivers have hybridized more recently.\nScientists have begun to build a list of “speciation genes” — different in different species — that help establish and maintain that parting of the ways. Despite the name, the job of those genes isn’t to draw lines in the sand between species. Those lines are a side effect of the genetic tweaks species gather by chance or while adapting to new environments.\nDead-end hybrids\nWhen Schumer began working with species of swordtail fish in Mexican rivers about six years ago, scientists still thought hybrids were rare among animals. But the fishes’ DNA told another tale. Their genetic blueprints, or genomes, were patchworks of different species’ DNA, indicating interbreeding with at least one other relative in the recent past. And by recent, Schumer means that hybridization became the rage among two species of Mexican swordtails just within the last 20 to 30 years (SN Online: 5/21/14). “We weren’t clear at the time if [hybridization] was something weird about swordtails,” she says, “but it’s becoming clear that many species groups are that way.”\nSometimes, hybridization brings benefits. For example, the famous Galápagos Islands finches named for Charles Darwin picked up survival advantages by interbreeding with other finch species (SN: 3/7/15, p. 7). But more often, hybrids don’t happen.\nGeographical barriers (mountains high enough, rivers wide enough) can prevent interspecies contact, as can out-of-sync mating cycles. Even when mating actually occurs, barriers still exist, says Michael Nachman, a population geneticist at the University of California, Berkeley. Fertility in hybrids is often subpar. Sperm from one species may not be able to fuse with eggs from another, and other molecular incompatibilities may cause embryos to fail. Sometimes being a hybrid is a death sentence. Those problems have genetic and physiological roots that scientists are only beginning to understand.\nA hybrid combines the genomes of both parents, a process similar to combining parts from two machines built under slightly different measuring systems. “You can take two fully functional complex machines and put them together and the whole thing falls apart,” says evolutionary geneticist Nitin Phadnis. Scientists can learn how species form by studying the wreckage of such hybrid machinery. In 2009, Phadnis, now at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, and H. Allen Orr of the University of Rochester in New York discovered, in fruit flies, one of the first known speciation genes.\nThings don’t necessarily fall apart right away, says Polly Campbell, an evolutionary geneticist at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater. As two species spend time apart adapting to separate environments, many changes accumulate in the species’ DNA. Such changes, or mutations, may alter the function or the structure of proteins produced by the genes. In a first-generation hybrid, those changes may not be visible. Parent Species A’s genes produce cogs that fit its cellular machinery and Parent Species B’s genes do the same. The hybrid inherits components to assemble fully functional versions of both parents’ machinery. But when hybrids go on to breed with each other, their offspring inherit different combinations of the original parent species’ genes. Sometimes that works out fine: A small proportion of the next generation may inherit all A machinery or all B machinery. Another proportion of offspring may get a mix of A and B cogs, but might be able to cobble together a biological machine that works well enough. A third segment of the offspring won’t be so lucky: They will be stuck trying to fit Species A’s cogs in an otherwise Species B machine (or vice versa), like a square peg in a round hole. Over time, enough offspring can inherit unworkable combinations of pegs and holes that the hybrids die out.\nStory continues after diagram\nBritannia Wanstrath has seen hybrid wreckage up-close. She is a technician who oversees mouse breeding and welfare at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nWhile trying to create better mouse strains for studying human diseases, she and other researchers may have inadvertently stumbled upon genes that render hybrids as dead ends. A massive effort known as the Collaborative Cross yielded 738 hybrid mouse lines by breeding an original eight strains of mice from three different subspecies, Mus musculus domesticus, M. musculus musculus and M. musculus castaneus (SN Online: 2/17/12). Those subspecies (or maybe species — the dividing line is fuzzy) are genetically similar. Because of small differences among the subspecies, researchers expected that a few of the new strains wouldn’t make it, says geneticist Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena, also at UNC Chapel Hill. “We expected some extinction, but very, very minor.”\nInstead, 95 percent of the 738 hybrid Collaborative Cross lines have gone extinct, Pardo-Manuel de Villena and colleagues reported in the June issue of Genetics.\nStory continues after graphic\nUp to speed\nEach color below represents DNA on chromosome 2 from an originating parent strain in the Collaborative Cross project, a large panel of inbred mice. Hybrid offspring with red in the black vertical box had DNA from one strain, called PWK/PhJ, and their sperm had faster back and forth motion than mice with DNA from other strains. Sperm motility may have been a problem for some of the strains that went extinct.\nOne of the mouse lines that expired, dubbed 5262, had particularly wild mice that were “difficult to handle and very vocal when agitated,” Wanstrath says. As researchers began breeding relatives in the line to each other so they would all be genetically identical, 5262’s breeding slowed. The inbred litters died soon after birth. The researchers tried everything they could think of to keep the line going, Wanstrath says. “Nothing worked.” Eventually, the last litter was born: one male and one female pup survived. The researchers were excited that they might be able to keep the line going. But the female died 12 days after birth and her brother was left alone. End of the line.\nThe researchers examined male mice from 347 of the extinct lines to find out what was going on. About 47 percent of the male mice in the extinct lines were infertile because of gene defects that prevented them from making good sperm. Some made no sperm. Some produced sperm with broken tails, unable to swim. Of the 183 male lines that were fertile, 99 could produce offspring only with distantly related females.\nThe scale of that extinction was unexpected, Campbell says, but male fertility problems aren’t a big surprise. Sperm production is a fragile process, she says. Still, those problems didn’t show up right away. It took generations of inbreeding to doom some hybrids. In the case of mice from the extinct lines, each round of inbreeding distributed the pegs and holes until the pieces no longer fit. In other lines, the sorting made workable combinations.\nThe barrier genes\nResearchers traced some of the hybrid mice’s fertility glitches to problems on the X chromosome. But this is bigger than one chromosome. “Many, many genes,” perhaps hundreds or thousands, are responsible for the incompatibility, Pardo-Manuel de Villena says. “They are located almost everywhere in the genome.” Because so many gene combinations led to extinction, it’s nearly impossible to say which are most important.\nUC Berkeley’s Nachman agrees that it’s not easy to figure out which of the thousands of genes in a hybrid’s genome is a speciation gene. He should know. “I’ve been searching for the last 10 years, and I’ve yet to find one,” he says.\nIn fact, in mammals, only one speciation gene has been identified so far. Geneticist Jiří Forejt of the Czech Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Molecular Genetics in Prague wasn’t looking for it when he caught wild mice and bred them with lab mice to study diversity of immune system genes. Hybrid males from those liaisons were sterile, he and colleagues discovered. “We had no idea we were working with two subspecies, musculus and domesticus,” he says. In 1974, Forejt narrowed the problem to a gene on one chromosome, then finally revealed the gene’s identity in 2009: PRDM9, which produces a protein that determines where on chromosomes genetic information gets swapped.\nWhen making sperm and eggs, organisms halve the number of chromosomes in those cells in a process called meiosis. That halving is necessary so that when an egg and sperm meet in fertilization, the embryo will have the correct number of chromosomes: half from the mother and half from the father. Cells going through meiosis must pass certain checkpoints. One of the biggest involves pairing the chromosomes to exchange bits with each other. That recombination is an important force in the evolution of sexually reproducing organisms because it allows for new combinations of genes.\nStory continues after images\nIn many mammals, including humans and mice, the PRDM9 protein marks where recombination will take place — the molecular equivalent of the orange flags that utility crews use to mark digging locations. PRDM9 grabs DNA using structures called zinc fingers. During evolution, those fingers develop a touch for different DNA sequences in different species. The sequence grabbed by M. musculus musculus’ PRDM9 zinc fingers is slightly different from the ones preferred by M. musculus domesticus’ zinc fingers. And so, the two subspecies carry out their DNA swaps at different places along the chromosomes. Mismatched recombination sites can hold up egg and sperm production, leaving hybrids infertile.\nDetails about how important it is to have the right zinc fingers came in a report last year in Nature. By re-engineering PRDM9’s zinc fingers, researchers moved recombination hot spots and restored fertility in male hybrid mice.\nBut PRDM9 can’t take all the blame for hybrid sterility between those mouse subspecies. “In many cases it’s combinations of many genes that result in this failure,” Forejt says. He and colleagues reported last year in PLOS Genetics that they had tracked another speciation gene that interacts with PRDM9 to a stretch of 4 million DNA bases on the X chromosome. There are at least six other genes in that part of the chromosome, and Forejt doesn’t yet know which one is a speciation gene.\nSometimes, PRDM9 plays no role in incompatibility. Many animals, including dogs, birds, crocodiles and amphibians, don’t have a working version of the gene, or don’t use it.\nStory continues after graph\nSuccess for sparrows\nSome hybrids, including some of Schumer’s fish and Darwin’s finches, have overcome whatever barriers might have been in the way of hybridization. These organisms have sorted out their parents’ differences and formed viable species of their own. Oslo’s Sætre and colleagues are studying one such species, the Italian sparrow, a blend of Spanish sparrows and house sparrows.\nThe bird’s origin story starts in the Middle East, where one of its parents, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), is native. In the last 10,000 years, house sparrows accompanied early farmers on migrations into Europe. There, the house sparrows encountered Spanish sparrows (Passer hispaniolensis), found in Europe and northern Africa. Mating between the species produced the Italian sparrow (Passer italiae), which lives on the Italian mainland and a few Mediterranean islands.\nItalian sparrows aren’t simple 1-to-1 mixtures of their parent species’ genes, Sætre and colleagues discovered. On average, 61.9 percent of the Italian sparrow’s DNA comes from house sparrows and 38.1 percent from Spanish sparrows, the researchers reported June 14 in Science Advances.\n“The genomes of these species have combined, but they’ve also been sorted,” Sætre says, yielding those unequal proportions. In some parts of the Italian sparrow’s genome, house sparrow genes have been purged, leaving only Spanish sparrow DNA. In other sections, the Spanish sparrow contribution got the heave-ho. Such genetic housecleaning was probably necessary to get a mix of genes that could work together.\nToday, Italian sparrows are largely cut off from their parents in the reproductive arena, Sætre says. In southern Italy where Italian and Spanish sparrows cross paths, Sætre and colleagues have tested more than 1,000 sparrows across several studies. Not a single one was a Spanish-Italian first-generation hybrid, indicating that impediments to breeding between the two species are high. In the Alps, Italian and house sparrows can sometimes breed, though genetic evidence suggests they rarely do. That reproductive isolation from its parents gives the Italian sparrow independent species status.\nIn the Italian sparrow, some genes have been tweaked from versions found in the parent species. These altered stretches of DNA are speciation gene suspects, but how such gene tweaks block reproduction isn’t known. “We’re not in a place where we can say what goes wrong biochemically,” Sætre says.\nCheckpoint discoveries\nFew researchers can point to a particular molecular wrench in the works that makes hybrids inviable, Phadnis says. “This is still cutting-edge science and an unsolved problem.”\nIn the few cases in which researchers have a handle on which genes are making hybrids sterile, there’s no guarantee the same genes or processes are involved in every failed species mash-up, he says. But he and colleagues are exploring a notion of what might be going wrong for some hybrids.\nPhadnis and colleagues have proposed a solution for an almost 100-year-old question about why crossing Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies with flies from its sister species Drosophila simulans results in dead male offspring. Researchers had already discovered that D. melanogaster has a gene called Hmr that’s involved in divvying up chromosomes. Hmr doesn’t play well with Lhr, a D. simulans gene that also helps make sure chromosomes are doled out properly. Scientists knew a third gene was involved in species’ incompatibility, but researchers had technical difficulties identifying it. Phadnis and colleagues reported in Science in 2015 that the gene called Su(Kpn) encodes a checkpoint protein, one that determines whether a cell has completed certain tasks and can go on to divide.\nSome of the molecular details are unknown, but Phadnis and colleagues propose that discrepancies between Hmr and Lhr may mess with the way cells divide their chromosomes. Because of the messed-up chromosomes, Su(Kpn) halts further cell division, arresting development and causing death of male offspring only, the researchers propose.\nArrested cell division may also be a problem for lab-made hybrids of two subspecies of Drosophila pseudoobscura on their way to becoming separate species. About 150,000 to 230,000 years ago, two subspecies — USA and Bogota — started to drift apart. Now, mating Bogota females and USA males produces infertile male hybrid offspring. The hybrid males can become weakly fertile in old age, but they produce mostly daughters. In 2009, Phadnis and Orr described in Science what was happening. The problem is selfishness. Specifically, a gene called Overdrive acts as a “selfish element” and skews sperm production so that hybrid males mainly make sperm carrying X chromosomes. That leaves only female offspring.\nBut Overdrive doesn’t work alone. At least six other genes are involved in the male sterility, Phadnis reported in 2011 in Genetics. As the USA and Bogota subspecies spend more and more time apart, they may layer on additional barriers. In unpublished work, Phadnis has discovered that Overdrive may also be putting the brakes on development, just as Su(Kpn) does. Its stopping power gets weaker with age, allowing some sperm production. Phadnis doesn’t know all the details yet, but then neither does anyone else.\n“Despite a lot of effort, there really isn’t a single system in which you can tell the complete details of any hybrid incompatibility,” Phadnis says.\nEven the yeasts that hybridize so readily in Maitreya Dunham’s beer barrel and that she intentionally breeds in her lab don’t have the whole hybridization thing worked out. Hybrid yeast often have fertility problems when reproducing sexually. Luckily for them, yeast can reproduce asexually, essentially making clones of themselves forever, Dunham says. “It doesn’t matter how messed up your genome is if you can make clones of yourself.”\nThis article appears in the November 11, 2017 issue of Science News with the headline, “Hybrids tell tales: When species manage to mix, they offer clues to reproductive barriers.”", "date": "2017-10-11 00:00:00", "category": "Science", "question": "Hybrids reveal the barriers to successful mating between species\n\n\nIt’s a tale as old as wine.

Those lines are a side effect of the genetic tweaks species gather by chance or while adapting to new environments.\nDead-end hybrids\nWhen Schumer began working with species of swordtail fish in Mexican rivers about six years ago, scientists still thought hybrids were rare among animals. But the fishes’ DNA told another tale. Their genetic blueprints, or genomes, were patchworks of different species’ DNA, indicating interbreeding with at least one other relative in the recent past. And by recent, Schumer means that hybridization became the rage among two species of Mexican swordtails just within the last 20 to 30 years (SN Online: 5/21/14). “We weren’t clear at the time if [hybridization] was something weird about swordtails,” she says, “but it’s becoming clear that many species groups are that way.”\nSometimes, hybridization brings benefits. For example, the famous Galápagos Islands finches named for Charles Darwin picked up survival advantages by interbreeding with other finch species (SN: 3/7/15, p. 7). But more often, hybrids don’t happen.\nGeographical barriers (mountains high enough, rivers wide enough) can prevent interspecies contact, as can out-of-sync mating cycles. Even when mating actually occurs, barriers still exist, says Michael Nachman, a population geneticist at the University of California, Berkeley. Fertility in hybrids is often subpar. Sperm from one species may not be able to fuse with eggs from another, and other molecular incompatibilities may cause embryos to fail. Sometimes being a hybrid is a death sentence. Those problems have genetic and physiological roots that scientists are only beginning to understand.\nA hybrid combines the genomes of both parents, a process similar to combining parts from two machines built under slightly different measuring systems. “You can take two fully functional complex machines and put them together and the whole thing falls apart,” says evolutionary geneticist Nitin Phadnis. Scientists can learn how species form by studying the wreckage of such hybrid machinery. In 2009, Phadnis, now at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, and H. Allen Orr of the University of Rochester in New York discovered, in fruit flies, one of the first known speciation genes.\nThings don’t necessarily fall apart right away, says Polly Campbell, an evolutionary geneticist at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater. As two species spend time apart adapting to separate environments, many changes accumulate in the species’ DNA. Such changes, or mutations, may alter the function or the structure of proteins produced by the genes. In a first-generation hybrid, those changes may not be visible. Parent Species A’s genes produce cogs that fit its cellular machinery and Parent Species B’s genes do the same. The hybrid inherits components to assemble fully functional versions of both parents’ machinery. But when hybrids go on to breed with each other, their offspring inherit different combinations of the original parent species’ genes. Sometimes that works out fine: A small proportion of the next generation may inherit all A machinery or all B machinery. Another proportion of offspring may get a mix of A and B cogs, but might be able to cobble together a biological machine that works well enough. A third segment of the offspring won’t be so lucky: They will be stuck trying to fit Species A’s cogs in an otherwise Species B machine (or vice versa), like a square peg in a round hole. Over time, enough offspring can inherit unworkable combinations of pegs and holes that the hybrids die out.\nStory continues after diagram\nBritannia Wanstrath has seen hybrid wreckage up-close. She is a technician who oversees mouse breeding and welfare at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nWhile trying to create better mouse strains for studying human diseases, she and other researchers may have inadvertently stumbled upon genes that render hybrids as dead ends. A massive effort known as the Collaborative Cross yielded 738 hybrid mouse lines by breeding an original eight strains of mice from three different subspecies, Mus musculus domesticus, M. musculus musculus and M. musculus castaneus (SN Online: 2/17/12). Those subspecies (or maybe species — the dividing line is fuzzy) are genetically similar. Because of small differences among the subspecies, researchers expected that a few of the new strains wouldn’t make it, says geneticist Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena, also at UNC Chapel Hill. “We expected some extinction, but very, very minor.”\nInstead, 95 percent of the 738 hybrid Collaborative Cross lines have gone extinct, Pardo-Manuel de Villena and colleagues reported in the June issue of Genetics.\nStory continues after graphic\nUp to speed\nEach color below represents DNA on chromosome 2 from an originating parent strain in the Collaborative Cross project, a large panel of inbred mice. Hybrid offspring with red in the black vertical box had DNA from one strain, called PWK/PhJ, and their sperm had faster back and forth motion than mice with DNA from other strains. Sperm motility may have been a problem for some of the strains that went extinct.\nOne of the mouse lines that expired, dubbed 5262, had particularly wild mice that were “difficult to handle and very vocal when agitated,” Wanstrath says. As researchers began breeding relatives in the line to each other so they would all be genetically identical, 5262’s breeding slowed. The inbred litters died soon after birth. The researchers tried everything they could think of to keep the line going, Wanstrath says. “Nothing worked.” Eventually, the last litter was born: one male and one female pup survived. The researchers were excited that they might be able to keep the line going. But the female died 12 days after birth and her brother was left alone. End of the line.\nThe researchers examined male mice from 347 of the extinct lines to find out what was going on. About 47 percent of the male mice in the extinct lines were infertile because of gene defects that prevented them from making good sperm. Some made no sperm. Some produced sperm with broken tails, unable to swim. Of the 183 male lines that were fertile, 99 could produce offspring only with distantly related females.\nThe scale of that extinction was unexpected, Campbell says, but male fertility problems aren’t a big surprise. Sperm production is a fragile process, she says. Still, those problems didn’t show up right away. It took generations of inbreeding to doom some hybrids. In the case of mice from the extinct lines, each round of inbreeding distributed the pegs and holes until the pieces no longer fit. In other lines, the sorting made workable combinations.\nThe barrier genes\nResearchers traced some of the hybrid mice’s fertility glitches to problems on the X chromosome. But this is bigger than one chromosome. “Many, many genes,” perhaps hundreds or thousands, are responsible for the incompatibility, Pardo-Manuel de Villena says. “They are located almost everywhere in the genome.” Because so many gene combinations led to extinction, it’s nearly impossible to say which are most important.\nUC Berkeley’s Nachman agrees that it’s not easy to figure out which of the thousands of genes in a hybrid’s genome is a speciation gene. He should know. “I’ve been searching for the last 10 years, and I’ve yet to find one,” he says.\nIn fact, in mammals, only one speciation gene has been identified so far. Geneticist Jiří Forejt of the Czech Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Molecular Genetics in Prague wasn’t looking for it when he caught wild mice and bred them with lab mice to study diversity of immune system genes. Hybrid males from those liaisons were sterile, he and colleagues discovered. “We had no idea we were working with two subspecies, musculus and domesticus,” he says. In 1974, Forejt narrowed the problem to a gene on one chromosome, then finally revealed the gene’s identity in 2009: PRDM9, which produces a protein that determines where on chromosomes genetic information gets swapped.\nWhen making sperm and eggs, organisms halve the number of chromosomes in those cells in a process called meiosis. That halving is necessary so that when an egg and sperm meet in fertilization, the embryo will have the correct number of chromosomes: half from the mother and half from the father. Cells going through meiosis must pass certain checkpoints. One of the biggest involves pairing the chromosomes to exchange bits with each other. That recombination is an important force in the evolution of sexually reproducing organisms because it allows for new combinations of genes.\nStory continues after images\nIn many mammals, including humans and mice, the PRDM9 protein marks where recombination will take place — the molecular equivalent of the orange flags that utility crews use to mark digging locations. PRDM9 grabs DNA using structures called zinc fingers. During evolution, those fingers develop a touch for different DNA sequences in different species. The sequence grabbed by M. musculus musculus’ PRDM9 zinc fingers is slightly different from the ones preferred by M. musculus domesticus’ zinc fingers. And so, the two subspecies carry out their DNA swaps at different places along the chromosomes. Mismatched recombination sites can hold up egg and sperm production, leaving hybrids infertile.\nDetails about how important it is to have the right zinc fingers came in a report last year in Nature. By re-engineering PRDM9’s zinc fingers, researchers moved recombination hot spots and restored fertility in male hybrid mice.\nBut PRDM9 can’t take all the blame for hybrid sterility between those mouse subspecies. “In many cases it’s combinations of many genes that result in this failure,” Forejt says. He and colleagues reported last year in PLOS Genetics that they had tracked another speciation gene that interacts with PRDM9 to a stretch of 4 million DNA bases on the X chromosome. There are at least six other genes in that part of the chromosome, and Forejt doesn’t yet know which one is a speciation gene.\nSometimes, PRDM9 plays no role in incompatibility. Many animals, including dogs, birds, crocodiles and amphibians, don’t have a working version of the gene, or don’t use it.\nStory continues after graph\nSuccess for sparrows\nSome hybrids, including some of Schumer’s fish and Darwin’s finches, have overcome whatever barriers might have been in the way of hybridization. These organisms have sorted out their parents’ differences and formed viable species of their own. Oslo’s Sætre and colleagues are studying one such species, the Italian sparrow, a blend of Spanish sparrows and house sparrows.\nThe bird’s origin story starts in the Middle East, where one of its parents, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), is native. In the last 10,000 years, house sparrows accompanied early farmers on migrations into Europe. There, the house sparrows encountered Spanish sparrows (Passer hispaniolensis), found in Europe and northern Africa. Mating between the species produced the Italian sparrow (Passer italiae), which lives on the Italian mainland and a few Mediterranean islands.\nItalian sparrows aren’t simple 1-to-1 mixtures of their parent species’ genes, Sætre and colleagues discovered. On average, 61.9 percent of the Italian sparrow’s DNA comes from house sparrows and 38.1 percent from Spanish sparrows, the researchers reported June 14 in Science Advances.\n“The genomes of these species have combined, but they’ve also been sorted,” Sætre says, yielding those unequal proportions. In some parts of the Italian sparrow’s genome, house sparrow genes have been purged, leaving only Spanish sparrow DNA. In other sections, the Spanish sparrow contribution got the heave-ho. Such genetic housecleaning was probably necessary to get a mix of genes that could work together.\nToday, Italian sparrows are largely cut off from their parents in the reproductive arena, Sætre says. In southern Italy where Italian and Spanish sparrows cross paths, Sætre and colleagues have tested more than 1,000 sparrows across several studies. Not a single one was a Spanish-Italian first-generation hybrid, indicating that impediments to breeding between the two species are high. In the Alps, Italian and house sparrows can sometimes breed, though genetic evidence suggests they rarely do. That reproductive isolation from its parents gives the Italian sparrow independent species status.\nIn the Italian sparrow, some genes have been tweaked from versions found in the parent species. These altered stretches of DNA are speciation gene suspects, but how such gene tweaks block reproduction isn’t known. “We’re not in a place where we can say what goes wrong biochemically,” Sætre says.\nCheckpoint discoveries\nFew researchers can point to a particular molecular wrench in the works that makes hybrids inviable, Phadnis says. “This is still cutting-edge science and an unsolved problem.”\nIn the few cases in which researchers have a handle on which genes are making hybrids sterile, there’s no guarantee the same genes or processes are involved in every failed species mash-up, he says. But he and colleagues are exploring a notion of what might be going wrong for some hybrids.\nPhadnis and colleagues have proposed a solution for an almost 100-year-old question about why crossing Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies with flies from its sister species Drosophila simulans results in dead male offspring. Researchers had already discovered that D. melanogaster has a gene called Hmr that’s involved in divvying up chromosomes. Hmr doesn’t play well with Lhr, a D. simulans gene that also helps make sure chromosomes are doled out properly. Scientists knew a third gene was involved in species’ incompatibility, but researchers had technical difficulties identifying it. Phadnis and colleagues reported in Science in 2015 that the gene called Su(Kpn) encodes a checkpoint protein, one that determines whether a cell has completed certain tasks and can go on to divide.\nSome of the molecular details are unknown, but Phadnis and colleagues propose that discrepancies between Hmr and Lhr may mess with the way cells divide their chromosomes. Because of the messed-up chromosomes, Su(Kpn) halts further cell division, arresting development and causing death of male offspring only, the researchers propose.\nArrested cell division may also be a problem for lab-made hybrids of two subspecies of Drosophila pseudoobscura on their way to becoming separate species. About 150,000 to 230,000 years ago, two subspecies — USA and Bogota — started to drift apart. Now, mating Bogota females and USA males produces infertile male hybrid offspring. The hybrid males can become weakly fertile in old age, but they produce mostly daughters. In 2009, Phadnis and Orr described in Science what was happening. The problem is selfishness. Specifically, a gene called Overdrive acts as a “selfish element” and skews sperm production so that hybrid males mainly make sperm carrying X chromosomes. That leaves only female offspring.\nBut Overdrive doesn’t work alone. At least six other genes are involved in the male sterility, Phadnis reported in 2011 in Genetics. As the USA and Bogota subspecies spend more and more time apart, they may layer on additional barriers. In unpublished work, Phadnis has discovered that Overdrive may also be putting the brakes on development, just as Su(Kpn) does. Its stopping power gets weaker with age, allowing some sperm production. Phadnis doesn’t know all the details yet, but then neither does anyone else.\n“Despite a lot of effort, there really isn’t a single system in which you can tell the complete details of any hybrid incompatibility,” Phadnis says.\nEven the yeasts that hybridize so readily in Maitreya Dunham’s beer barrel and that she intentionally breeds in her lab don’t have the whole hybridization thing worked out. Hybrid yeast often have fertility problems when reproducing sexually. Luckily for them, yeast can reproduce asexually, essentially making clones of themselves forever, Dunham says. “It doesn’t matter how messed up your genome is if you can make clones of yourself.”\nThis article appears in the November 11, 2017 issue of Science News with the headline, “Hybrids tell tales: When species manage to mix, they offer clues to reproductive barriers.”", "answer": "Researchers have found that even though separate species can't typically mate and produce fertile offspring, hybrids do occur in various organisms, including plants, fish, birds, mice, and fruit flies. By studying these hybrids, scientists can gain insight into the process of speciation, the separation of a population into different species. They have discovered that hybrids often face fertility problems due to genetic and physiological barriers, and that many genes, rather than a single gene, contribute to these incompatibilities.", "validated": "Ok"}

The discovery comes as a big surprise to researchers who have been searching for genetic evidence of human-Neandertal interbreeding for years and finding none.\nAbout 1 percent to 4 percent of DNA in modern people from Europe and Asia was inherited from Neandertals, researchers report in the May 7 Science. “It’s a small, but very real proportion of our ancestry,” says study coauthor David Reich of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Mass. Comparisons of the human and Neandertal genomes are also revealing how humans evolved to become the sole living hominid species on the planet.\nNeandertals lived in Europe, the Middle East and western Asia until they disappeared about 30,000 years ago. The new data indicate that humans may not have replaced Neandertals, but assimilated them into the human gene pool.\n“Neandertals are not totally extinct; they live on in some of us,” says Svante Pääbo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and leader of the Neandertal genome project.\nHe and other geneticists involved in the effort to compile the complete genetic instruction book of Neandertals didn’t expect to find that Neandertals had left a genetic legacy. Earlier analyses that looked at only a small part of the genome had contradicted the notion that humans and Neandertals intermixed (SN Online: 8/7/08).\n“We as a consortium came into this with a very, very strong bias against gene flow,” Reich says. In fact, when he and his colleagues announced the completion of a rough draft of the Neandertal genome a year ago, the researchers said such genetic exchange was unlikely (SN: 3/14/09, p. 5).\nBut several independent lines of evidence now convince the researchers that humans and Neandertals did interbreed. “The breakthrough here is to show that it could happen and it did happen,” Pääbo says.\nThe result came as no surprise to some scientists, however. Archaeologists have described ancient skeletons from Europe that had characteristics of both early modern humans and Neandertals; evidence, the researchers say, of interbreeding between the two groups. But until the cataloging of the entire Neanderthal genome, genetic studies could find no evidence to support the idea.\n“After all these years the geneticists are coming to the same conclusions that some of us in the field of archaeology and human paleontology have had for a long time,” says João Zilhão, an archaeologist and paleoanthropologist at the University of Bristol in England. “What can I say? If the geneticists come to this same conclusion, that’s to be expected.”\nResearchers re-created the Neandertal’s genetic blueprints using DNA extracted from three bone fragments — each from a different Neandertal woman — found in a cave in Croatia.\nComparing the resulting blueprints of the female Neandertals, who lived about 40,000 years ago, with those of five present-day humans from China, France, Papua New Guinea and southern and western Africa, revealed that people outside of Africa carry Neandertal DNA.\nScientists were surprised to find that people from China and Papua New Guinea (places where Neandertals never lived) have just as much Neandertal ancestry as people from France. The group did not find traces of Neandertal heritage in the two African people studied. The result probably means that interbreeding between Neandertals and humans took place about 50,000 to 80,000 years ago in the Middle East as humans began migrating out of Africa to colonize the rest of the world, Reich says.\nIt is not clear how extensive interbreeding was; the data are consistent with either a short period with a great deal of interbreeding or with a long period of little interbreeding, says Richard E. (Ed) Green, a genome biologist now at the University of California Santa Cruz and a coauthor of the new study.\nComparison of the Neandertal genome to human and chimpanzee genetic sequences have led to some clues about recent human evolution. Neandertals “were not genetically very distinct from us,” says Pääbo. For example, the researchers were able to find only 78 proteins in which humans carry a different amino acid than is found in Neandertals and chimpanzees. That means that few changes in proteins have taken place in the past few hundred thousand years of human evolution. Researchers don’t know yet whether the changes in the proteins alter their function or give humans some survival advantage.\nBut some parts of the human genome clearly do produce an evolutionary advantage, the researchers say. Again, the team compared the human genome to those of Neandertals and chimpanzees and identified places where humans differ. If nothing of importance had happened in human evolution since humans and Neandertals diverged, such changes would be spread evenly across the genome, Green says. Instead, the researchers found large swaths of the genome where humans have distinct changes not found in Neandertals or chimpanzees. The team identified 212 such regions where “selective sweeps” were likely to have happened, many of which include genes involved in brain function. The researchers don’t yet know what the changes are or how they produce a selective advantage.\n“These data are really a goldmine for understanding recent human evolution,” Green says.\nSince humans and Neandertals could interbreed, some people question whether the two groups are different hominid species. The question doesn’t hold interest for John Hawks, an anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Genealogically, he says, the new study shows that many humans had a Neandertal great-great-great-great … grandfather. “It’s impossible to talk about them as ‘them’ anymore,” he says. “Neandertals are us.”\n______________________________________________________________________\nBack Story | Fossil clues to intermingling\nSome archaeologists have long argued that fossil evidence suggests interbreeding between Homo sapiens and Neandertals.\n1.
