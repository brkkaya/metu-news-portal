The Turkey Mediterranean Hub, which will be established at the end of the workshop, aims to develop permanent practices to prevent and eliminate pollution in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nHosted by the Mersin Chamber of Commerce and Industry, organized by METU Graduate School of Marine Sciences with the contributions of Mersin Metropolitan Municipality, Mersin Chamber of Shipping, and the Mersin Economy Platform, “Turkey, Mediterranean Hub Establishment Workshop” was held on December 12, 2023, to support the goals of the Horizon Europe Restore Our Oceans and Waters Mission regarding clean seas and oceans. Nearly 100 participants, including academics, decision-makers, non-governmental organizations, and representatives from the maritime sectors, attended the workshop.\nThe event featured national and international practices to prevent and eliminate pollution in the Mediterranean Sea. In the panel where the city’s stakeholders took part, Chambers, Ministry Provincial Directorates, Development Agency, and university representatives exchanged ideas on how their institutions and organizations could contribute to working together for a clean Mediterranean Sea.\n\nDiscussions were held with the participants on the challenges, actions, and priorities towards the goal of preventing and eliminating pollution in the Mediterranean Sea. Assessments were conducted to develop an attractive and well-functioning basin-scale innovation ecosystem for investments and businesses.\n\nIn the opening speech of the event, Prof. Dr. Barış Salihoğlu, Director of METU Graduate School of Marine Sciences, started by underlining that the increasing climate pressure on seas has become something more and more commonly talked about in recent years. Noting that there are many pressures on the seas, not only the climate, Salihoğlu pointed out that pollution is at the forefront of these and said the following: “Of course, it is not possible to evaluate the pressure of pollution all by itself. We must address the issue alongside many other types of pressure such as climate, invasive species, excessive or uncontrolled hunting and constructions. Marine ecosystems have been severely damaged along our coasts, and this is similarly reflected in the economy. Our goal is to strengthen and continue the efforts we started with city stakeholders on the Blue Economy, which we have been discussing for a long time and started a while ago to find solutions by strengthening it with the workshop we hold today. Today, we are together with local authorities, development agencies, sector representatives, research institutions such as TÜBİTAK, and universities. We aim to continue working in this area for lots of years with the synergy we will create together.”\nIn his speech, Salihoğlu emphasized the importance of producing scientific and innovation-based solutions for sustainability while benefiting from the seas. He stated that they aim for solution-oriented, science-based, and innovative projects to be conducted within Turkey Mediterranean Hub. After expressing his desire to strengthen collaborations between researchers, the private sector, and local authorities, he went on to say that the Hub’s main goals include developing technology, generating social innovation, and seeking ideas on how to create joint financing for sustainable business model applications. He said, “The main goal should be for this Hub to become a living laboratory.”\n\nSpeaking at the opening of the workshop, Hakan Sefa Çakır, Chair of the Mersin Chamber of Commerce and Industry, stated that they see nature as the common value of the entire world and said: “We use most of these resources together with the rest of the world. In this sense, we are aware of our responsibility in using what nature offers us, especially water.” He emphasized that the required awareness has not been yet raised in this matter and that everyone, from industrialists to farmers, from local authorities to regular citizens, should be in unity of action. He also said that Mersin should have a common memorandum of understanding with a holistic goal. Considering the city’s strength in agriculture and tourism, Çakır pointed out that the primary area of focus in Mersin should be water and sea. “After all, other sub-issues depend on the health of water and seas,” he added. After expressing his belief in the fact that the workshop will demonstrate actions that trigger common solutions soon, Çakır said the following about the workshop where the next steps to be taken for cleaner and sustainable seas regarding the pollution problem in the Mediterranean were discussed: “We will talk about what promises the institutions will give in these matters, whether social, industrial or financial, in line with their fields of activity and how we can cooperate and how institutions can support each other in the preparation and implementation of roadmaps for waste-free and clean seas. As you know, pollution in the seas also poses an obstacle to the Blue Economy in the sustainable use of marine resources. Considering this, the steps our institutions can take, even if small, to prevent pollution and the ways we can develop collaborations in line with this goal will be discussed. Your opinions and suggestions, with the contribution of all the guests here today, will be an important part of this synergy.”\n\nCihat Lokmanoğlu, Chair of the Board of Directors of Mersin Chamber of Shipping, also shared the efforts of his chamber for a clean sea. Noting that the seas and oceans, which play a key role in sustaining life, are under the pressure of human activities and climate change, Lokmanoğlu stated that there are lots of threats that can be talked about, ranging from the increasing water temperatures at oceans to rising sea levels, from increased acidification and pollution to ecosystem degradation. Pointing out that we will have to face irreversible outcomes if a solution is not produced to these problems, Lokmanoğlu emphasized that the solution requires global cooperation and determination.  “However, I believe that local and regional efforts and collaborations, as the one we have here today, will play a significant role in mitigating the problems,” said Lokmanoğlu, adding, “We can get results regarding cleaning the seas if we act together. As such, I care about the unity here and believe that we can find effective strategies and common solutions.”\n\nProf. Dr. Ahmet Hakan Öztürk, the Vice President of Mersin University, also stated that they are ready to support all kinds of efforts in this matter as a university.\n\nFor more information regarding the workshop, please visit: http://ims.metu.edu.tr/tr/slayt/misyon-okyanuslar-turkiye-akdeniz-hubinin-kurulmasi-calistayi\n", "date": "2023-12-29T15:57:07+03:00", "question": "Mediterranean stakeholders come together for waste-free and clean oceans\n\nThrough the “Restore Our Oceans and Waters Mission: Turkey, Mediterranean Hub Establishment Workshop,” organized with the support of Horizon Europe BlueMissionMed, a roadmap has been determined.\n\nStakeholders of the Mediterranean Sea continue their efforts to clean the oceans and waters, increase income from the marine economy, and enable the sustainable use of marine resources.

According to the study, the largest displacement and energy release in these earthquakes occurred 24 seconds later when the rupture moved northward and triggered the East Anatolian Fault Zone, which has been accumulating stress for centuries. Due to the bidirectional nature of the rupture, the first earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 Mw activated the entire East Anatolian Fault Zone. Approximately 9 hours after the initial earthquake that took place early in the morning, a second major earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 Mw occurred on the east-west trending Çardak-Sürgü Fault. The article suggests that these two consecutive earthquakes indicate a causal relationship.\nThe authors of the article emphasize that major earthquakes taking place in densely populated areas have resulted in significant loss of life and economic damage throughout human history. The article underlines the importance of data to be obtained through immediate observations in the epicenter and surrounding areas of earthquakes on land. However, it is mentioned that these observation efforts tend to be hindered or quickly disrupted due to various reasons. Among these reasons are the repair of damaged infrastructure, rescue and recovery operations, the threat of powerful aftershocks, difficulties in reaching the areas to be examined, and the rapid erosion of fault scarps.\nDespite all challenges, the surface rupture at the epicenter was reached a few days after the earthquakes as part of the conducted studies. In addition to the surface rupture, a detailed map of the displacements along the slip lines on fault places and newly formed fault traces was completed. Furthermore, a highly detailed depiction of surface deformations caused by the earthquake was obtained. This article documents the fieldwork, observations, and data obtained over a period of approximately 5 weeks following the earthquake, utilizing drone images and on-site investigations. Additionally, this study presents a significant database regarding surface deformations during the earthquakes along strike-slip faults on a continental scale, the mechanisms of rupture propagation, and how movement is transferred among complex fault systems. The article also introduces a new approach to understanding the displacement along related fault systems and global plate movements.\nThe article highlights that the earthquakes that took place on February 6, 2023, were actually a previously predicted natural event. It is mentioned that TMMOB (Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects) Chamber of Geological Engineers and its member geological engineers had previously warned about the high probability of a major earthquake caused by the East Anatolian Fault in the near future. This warning had been reiterated on numerous occasions, especially after the earthquake in Elazığ on January 24, 2020. The data and interpretations included in this study provide information that will contribute to a better understanding of earthquakes and the faults that cause them as the information is presented in a rather simple language that can be understood by both geology experts and the general public.\nThe article, authored by Prof. Dr. Erdin Bozkurt from METU, along with Prof. Dr. Mehmet Nuri Bodur from Hakkari University, Walter D.

The program, broadcast live on YouTube, was attended by students from METU Space Team (METUOR), METU Aerospace Society (ODTÜ HUT), METU Amateur Astronomy Society (ODTÜ AAT), and METU Rocket Society. During the program, Prof. Dr. Oğuz Uzol from the Department of Aerospace Engineering at METU explained the stages of the launch and propulsion systems. Additionally, Prof. Dr. Mustafa Yücel from METU Graduate School of Marine Sciences, Asst. Prof. Dr. Berat Haznedaroğlu from Boğaziçi University Institute of Environmental Sciences, and Prof. Dr. Güneş Esendağlı from Hacettepe University Graduate School of Health Sciences talked about the experiments to be conducted in the microgravity environment of the International Space Station as part of the mission.\nSelçuk Türkmen, one of the members of the METU Office of Science Communication and the host of the program, shared the following information about the AX-3 mission and the crew that it will take to the International Space Station:\n“The crew going to the ISS with Axiom Mission 3 consists of four members. Our astronaut Alper Gezeravcı is accompanied by mission commander Michael López-Alegría, mission pilot Walter Villadei, and mission specialist Marcust Wandt. The fact that the number of commercial space missions are increasing indicates the growing diversity of space exploration efforts. Our esteemed astronaut Alper Gezeravcı and his fellow crew members will conduct more than 30 scientific experiments on the ISS. And we would like to particularly emphasize the scientific importance of experiments to be conducted in microgravity environments, specifically on the ISS.”\nFollowing Türkmen’s opening speech, the program continued with the vide interviews conducted before the live broadcast. The first interview featured Prof. Dr. Mustafa Yücel from the Graduate School of Marine Sciences at METU. “We are witnessing a historic moment,” Dr. Yücel stated. He underlined the significance of the microgravity environment experiments that would enable future space travelers and astronauts to stay in space for extended periods and went on to say that our universities have submitted excellent experiments in this regard. Dr. Yücel also informed the audience about his study that combines deep-sea habitats and space exploration.\nFollowing Prof. Dr. Mustafa Yücel’s interview, the program continued with the interviews featuring the project leaders of two experiments, “UzMAn” and “Miyeloid,” which Alper Gezeravcı will conduct on the ISS.\n“Uzay Görevlileri için Mikroalgal Yaşam Destek Üniteleri (Microalgal Life Support Units for Space Missions),” or shortly titled as the “UzMAn” project, is led by Asst. Prof. Dr. Berat Haznedaroğlu from Boğaziçi University Institute of Environmental Sciences. Dr. Haznedaroğlu said that this would be the first microalgae-related experiment in this field and shared the following information regarding the purpose of the experiment:\n“When the world of photosynthetic organisms are examined, it can clearly be seen that algae are the most efficient organisms in converting carbon dioxide into oxygen because they are oxygen-producing photosynthetic organisms. In fact, algae have the best photosynthetic efficiency. Furthermore, in the formation of the Earth’s atmosphere, approximately sixty to seventy percent of the oxygen comes algae in the seas.\nWe have sent a total of three eukaryotic microalgae species to the Space Station. Over the course of ten days, Gezeravcı will essentially obtain a growth graph for these three species. They will operate with enriched carbon dioxide because one of the goals is to use the oxygen produced by the algae as a biological system to purify the air for space mission staff. These three species have never been sent to the Space Station before. This means that they will be tested in this regard for the first time. In addition to studying the growth of algae in a microgravity environment, we will also examine their cellular and molecular changes in this period. At the end of ten days, Gezeravcı will open this box and metabolically freeze our algae. In other words, he will preserve all the changes they have gone through in microgravity by freezing them there and bring them back to Turkey.\nThe project titled “Uzay Misyonuna Katılan Bireylerde Radyasyona Maruz Kalmanın Kanser İçin Öncül Lezyonlar Olan Periferik Kandaki Miyeloid-Kökenli Baskılayıcı Hücrelere Etkisinin İncelenmesi (Investigation of the Effect of Radiation Exposure on Peripheral Blood Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells, Precursor Lesions for Cancer, in Individuals Participating in Space Missions,)” or shortly named “Miyeloid,” is led by Prof. Dr. Güneş Esendağlı from Hacettepe University Graduate School of Health Sciences. Upon stating that the immune system of astronauts would be examined under all stress conditions with this experiment, Dr. Esendağlı shared the following information:\n“Our study focuses on cancer and the immune system. How are the immune systems of astronauts affected under all stress conditions and how can it be related to cancer? We aimed to work on various observational parameters regarding these questions. Immune system cells are primarily associated with the bone marrow, specifically the group of cells called white blood cells circulating in our blood. These cells are among the most frequently renewed cell groups in the bloodstream of our bodies. We are in the process of gaining insights into how the immune system changes with small alterations by examining the bone marrow. All the conditions the astronauts are exposed to during the preparation process and various factors they encounter as they go to the ISS result in significant changes in human physiology. These alterations can directly trigger the immune system. In addition to obtaining data on which direction the immune system is heading in such cases, the cell groups we will examine have not been reported before. Therefore, this study, conducted by Turkish scientists for the first time, will contribute to the literature in the field by adding various new parameters.”\nFollowing Prof. Dr. Güneş Esendağlı’s interview, the program continued as Emre Okutucu, one of the student members of METU Space Team (METUOR), shared their journey of gaining the 2nd place in last year’s International CanSat Model Satellite Competition with their project titled “Küçük Boyutlara Sığabilen, Hafif ve Görevleri Başarıyla Gerçekleştiren Model Uydu Tasarımı (Small-Sized, Lightweight, and Successfully Performing Model Satellite Design.)” Then, Sude Ataseven, another member of METUOR, talked about their group’s latest projects.\n", "date": "2024-01-30T14:16:32+03:00", "question": "Special event held to bid farewell to our first space traveler Alper Gezeravcı\n\nMETU organized a special program to send off our first space traveler Alper Gezeravcı altogether. During the program, the launch process of the Axiom Mission 3 (Ax-3) was followed, and the 13 experiments to be conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) by Gezeravcı were discussed.\n\nOn January 18, 2024, a special program was held by METU Office of Science Communication in collaboration with the Center for Audiovisual Research and Production (GİSAM) to follow the launch of Ax-3 mission that sent our first space traveler, Alper Gezeravcı, into space. The program, broadcast live on YouTube, was attended by students from METU Space Team (METUOR), METU Aerospace Society (ODTÜ HUT), METU Amateur Astronomy Society (ODTÜ AAT), and METU Rocket Society. During the program, Prof. Dr. Oğuz Uzol from the Department of Aerospace Engineering at METU explained the stages of the launch and propulsion systems. Additionally, Prof. Dr. Mustafa Yücel from METU Graduate School of Marine Sciences, Asst. Prof. Dr. Berat Haznedaroğlu from Boğaziçi University Institute of Environmental Sciences, and Prof. Dr. Güneş Esendağlı from Hacettepe University Graduate School of Health Sciences talked about the experiments to be conducted in the microgravity environment of the International Space Station as part of the mission.\nSelçuk Türkmen, one of the members of the METU Office of Science Communication and the host of the program, shared the following information about the AX-3 mission and the crew that it will take to the International Space Station:\n“The crew going to the ISS with Axiom Mission 3 consists of four members. Our astronaut Alper Gezeravcı is accompanied by mission commander Michael López-Alegría, mission pilot Walter Villadei, and mission specialist Marcust Wandt. The fact that the number of commercial space missions are increasing indicates the growing diversity of space exploration efforts. Our esteemed astronaut Alper Gezeravcı and his fellow crew members will conduct more than 30 scientific experiments on the ISS. And we would like to particularly emphasize the scientific importance of experiments to be conducted in microgravity environments, specifically on the ISS.”\nFollowing Türkmen’s opening speech, the program continued with the vide interviews conducted before the live broadcast. The first interview featured Prof. Dr. Mustafa Yücel from the Graduate School of Marine Sciences at METU. “We are witnessing a historic moment,” Dr. Yücel stated. He underlined the significance of the microgravity environment experiments that would enable future space travelers and astronauts to stay in space for extended periods and went on to say that our universities have submitted excellent experiments in this regard. Dr. Yücel also informed the audience about his study that combines deep-sea habitats and space exploration.\nFollowing Prof. Dr. Mustafa Yücel’s interview, the program continued with the interviews featuring the project leaders of two experiments, “UzMAn” and “Miyeloid,” which Alper Gezeravcı will conduct on the ISS.\n“Uzay Görevlileri için Mikroalgal Yaşam Destek Üniteleri (Microalgal Life Support Units for Space Missions),” or shortly titled as the “UzMAn” project, is led by Asst. Prof. Dr. Berat Haznedaroğlu from Boğaziçi University Institute of Environmental Sciences. Dr. Haznedaroğlu said that this would be the first microalgae-related experiment in this field and shared the following information regarding the purpose of the experiment:\n“When the world of photosynthetic organisms are examined, it can clearly be seen that algae are the most efficient organisms in converting carbon dioxide into oxygen because they are oxygen-producing photosynthetic organisms. In fact, algae have the best photosynthetic efficiency. Furthermore, in the formation of the Earth’s atmosphere, approximately sixty to seventy percent of the oxygen comes algae in the seas.\nWe have sent a total of three eukaryotic microalgae species to the Space Station. Over the course of ten days, Gezeravcı will essentially obtain a growth graph for these three species. They will operate with enriched carbon dioxide because one of the goals is to use the oxygen produced by the algae as a biological system to purify the air for space mission staff. These three species have never been sent to the Space Station before. This means that they will be tested in this regard for the first time. In addition to studying the growth of algae in a microgravity environment, we will also examine their cellular and molecular changes in this period. At the end of ten days, Gezeravcı will open this box and metabolically freeze our algae. In other words, he will preserve all the changes they have gone through in microgravity by freezing them there and bring them back to Turkey.\nThe project titled “Uzay Misyonuna Katılan Bireylerde Radyasyona Maruz Kalmanın Kanser İçin Öncül Lezyonlar Olan Periferik Kandaki Miyeloid-Kökenli Baskılayıcı Hücrelere Etkisinin İncelenmesi (Investigation of the Effect of Radiation Exposure on Peripheral Blood Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells, Precursor Lesions for Cancer, in Individuals Participating in Space Missions,)” or shortly named “Miyeloid,” is led by Prof. Dr. Güneş Esendağlı from Hacettepe University Graduate School of Health Sciences.

The event, organized in collaboration with METU, the Institut français Türkiye under the Embassy of France in Turkey, the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), Adım Adım Sıfır Atık, and the Mediterranean Conservation Society, will feature discussions conducted in English. Speakers include Dr. Franck Courchamp, Director of Research at CNRS and AXA Chair at Paris-Saclay University, alongside Prof. Mustafa Yücel and Assoc. Prof. Koray Yılmaz from METU.\nIn the conference to be moderated by Fabien Flori, Deputy General Manager of Institut français Türkiye and Deputy Cultural Counselor, Dr. Franck Courchamp will deliver a speech titled “Biodiversity: Are We Facing the 6th Extinction?” discussing the definition of biodiversity, as well as its quantitative and qualitative significance, in addition to explaining the reasons and mechanisms behind the loss of biodiversity. In his presentation, Courchamp will also address the question “Are we truly within the 6th mass extinction in the history of our planet?” Additionally, Assoc. Prof. Koray Yılmaz from the Department of Geological Engineering at METU will deliver a presentation titled “Navigating Water Cycle Extremes in a Changing Climate: Eastern Mediterranean Perspective.” Then, Prof. Mustafa Yücel from the Graduate School of Marine Sciences at METU will talk about the “Effect of Multiple Stressors on the Eastern Mediterranean Sea Ecosystem.”\nParticipation in the event, which is open to everyone and free of charge, only requires filling out the registration form in advance. The form can be accessed here.\nThe events titled “The Mediterranean, A Sea Under Pressure,” aim to raise awareness about marine biodiversity ahead of the United Nations Ocean Conference that will be held in 2025 in Nice, and the “Mediterranean Season” in 2026.\n\nThere are a total of 21 countries with coastlines bordering the unique natural area of the Mediterranean Sea, and it is crucial for all these states to collaborate to ensure the healthy functioning of this vast marine ecosystem. The need for such a collaboration increases each and every day because the balance in the Mediterranean is disturbed more and more, leading to a decline in the quality of life for those living around its shores. Due to climate change resulting in increased water temperatures, population density, overexploitation of natural resources, and environmental pollution, the Mediterranean is hurtling towards a major catastrophe.\nDespite covering only 0.7% of the world’s total ocean area, the Mediterranean is home to 8% of the world’s fauna diversity, 18% of the flora diversity, and 28% of the endemic diversity. This significant diversity and wealth is currently under major threat due to climate change. While certain species are declining in population in the Mediterranean, the number of various invasive species such as blue crabs and lionfish are increasing. Various factors such as maritime transportation, fishing, offshore drilling, destructive tourism, artificialization of the coastline and seabed, inadequate waste management along the coasts, as well as telluric and plastic pollution, contribute to the reduction in biological diversity in the Mediterranean. Approximately 40% of the species in the Mediterranean currently face the threat of extinction.\nAs of today, only 8% of the Mediterranean is designated as a marine protected area. Furthermore, the areas where human activity is minimized is only 0.04% of the entire area. Despite the agreement among 21 coastal states within the Barcelona Convention to protect at least 30% of the entire Mediterranean, with 10% of it designated as high protection, by the year 2030, high protection levels have yet to be achieved in marine protected areas due to the lack of swift implementation of proper governance mechanisms.\nTurkey hosts extraordinary biological diversity while also being adversely affected by climate change. Local initiatives such as the reintroduction of Posidonia plants, combating illegal fishing, and promoting ecotourism are of great significance in this regard. However, beyond these local initiatives, the question of how to adapt to the consequences of the global issue of increasing sea water temperature remains crucial.\nIt is known that the climate has been changing due to human activities, leading to global temperature rise.

The event, organized in collaboration with METU, the Institut français Türkiye under the Embassy of France in Turkey, the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), Adım Adım Sıfır Atık, and the Mediterranean Conservation Society, will feature discussions conducted in English. Speakers include Dr. Franck Courchamp, Director of Research at CNRS and AXA Chair at Paris-Saclay University, alongside Prof. Mustafa Yücel and Assoc. Prof. Koray Yılmaz from METU.\nIn the conference to be moderated by Fabien Flori, Deputy General Manager of Institut français Türkiye and Deputy Cultural Counselor, Dr. Franck Courchamp will deliver a speech titled “Biodiversity: Are We Facing the 6th Extinction?” discussing the definition of biodiversity, as well as its quantitative and qualitative significance, in addition to explaining the reasons and mechanisms behind the loss of biodiversity. In his presentation, Courchamp will also address the question “Are we truly within the 6th mass extinction in the history of our planet?” Additionally, Assoc. Prof. Koray Yılmaz from the Department of Geological Engineering at METU will deliver a presentation titled “Navigating Water Cycle Extremes in a Changing Climate: Eastern Mediterranean Perspective.” Then, Prof. Mustafa Yücel from the Graduate School of Marine Sciences at METU will talk about the “Effect of Multiple Stressors on the Eastern Mediterranean Sea Ecosystem.”\nParticipation in the event, which is open to everyone and free of charge, only requires filling out the registration form in advance. The form can be accessed here.\nThe events titled “The Mediterranean, A Sea Under Pressure,” aim to raise awareness about marine biodiversity ahead of the United Nations Ocean Conference that will be held in 2025 in Nice, and the “Mediterranean Season” in 2026.\n\nThere are a total of 21 countries with coastlines bordering the unique natural area of the Mediterranean Sea, and it is crucial for all these states to collaborate to ensure the healthy functioning of this vast marine ecosystem. The need for such a collaboration increases each and every day because the balance in the Mediterranean is disturbed more and more, leading to a decline in the quality of life for those living around its shores. Due to climate change resulting in increased water temperatures, population density, overexploitation of natural resources, and environmental pollution, the Mediterranean is hurtling towards a major catastrophe.\nDespite covering only 0.7% of the world’s total ocean area, the Mediterranean is home to 8% of the world’s fauna diversity, 18% of the flora diversity, and 28% of the endemic diversity. This significant diversity and wealth is currently under major threat due to climate change. While certain species are declining in population in the Mediterranean, the number of various invasive species such as blue crabs and lionfish are increasing. Various factors such as maritime transportation, fishing, offshore drilling, destructive tourism, artificialization of the coastline and seabed, inadequate waste management along the coasts, as well as telluric and plastic pollution, contribute to the reduction in biological diversity in the Mediterranean. Approximately 40% of the species in the Mediterranean currently face the threat of extinction.\nAs of today, only 8% of the Mediterranean is designated as a marine protected area. Furthermore, the areas where human activity is minimized is only 0.04% of the entire area. Despite the agreement among 21 coastal states within the Barcelona Convention to protect at least 30% of the entire Mediterranean, with 10% of it designated as high protection, by the year 2030, high protection levels have yet to be achieved in marine protected areas due to the lack of swift implementation of proper governance mechanisms.\nTurkey hosts extraordinary biological diversity while also being adversely affected by climate change. Local initiatives such as the reintroduction of Posidonia plants, combating illegal fishing, and promoting ecotourism are of great significance in this regard. However, beyond these local initiatives, the question of how to adapt to the consequences of the global issue of increasing sea water temperature remains crucial.\nIt is known that the climate has been changing due to human activities, leading to global temperature rise. Moreover, the Mediterranean is reported to be warming at a rate 20% faster than the rest of the world. Therefore, before reaching a point of no return, urgent action against climate insensitivity is needed to preserve the ecosystems and biodiversity in the Mediterranean.\nIn the upcoming stages of the event series, discussions will be held with a multidisciplinary perspective around three main themes: coastal zone governance, the intersection of climate issues with biodiversity loss, and the social consequences of ecological collapse.\n\nIn addition to the discussions, there will be various other activities including Posidonia planting, workshops focusing on marine biodiversity, awareness-raising events, experience-sharing gatherings, and educational programs that combine the transformative power of art with biodiversity loss in the Mediterranean.

Recognizing that cognitive science is a multidisciplinary field aimed at understanding all aspects of human cognition and other forms of intelligence such as artificial intelligence, ISBCS featured presentations by researchers across numerous disciplines varying from linguistics, computer science and artificial intelligence to anthropology, psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and education. In alignment with the multifaceted nature of cognitive science, the symposium addressed its main subject from multiple dimensions through the presentations.\nJointly organized by Middle East Technical University, Boğaziçi University and Yeditepe University, the three universities in Turkey offering cognitive science programs, the International Symposium on Brain and Cognitive Science is held annually to bring together researchers and students from leading national and international centers in fields related to cognitive sciences.\nAt the symposium that started with a keynote speech by Prof. Banu Günel Kılıç, the Director of the Graduate School of Informatics at METU, other invited speakers included Prof. Jeff Cohn from the University of Pittsburgh, Prof. Metehan Çiçek from Ankara University, and Prof. Tilbe Göksun from Koç University. In addition to keynote speeches, the event featured a panel discussion and poster presentations.\nIn his speech titled “Objective Measurement and Analysis of Internalizing Disorders Using Multimodal Machine Learning for Clinical Science and Treatment,” Prof. Jeff Cohn focused on the treatment process of psychopathological disorders, emphasizing the significance of reliable and effective measurement in assessing treatment response. Dr. Cohn highlighted that while the latest technology in diagnosis and clinical endpoint measurement, including self-reporting and clinical interviews, helps evaluate the severity of the illness, it still is a subjective method. He went on to say that self-reporting and clinical interviews are difficult to standardize within and across settings, in addition to the fact that they impose a burden on patients and lack certain details. Prof. Cohn noted that multimodal machine learning increasingly offers a robust alternative to these standard approaches.\n\nIn his speech titled “Social Stress and Time Perception Interaction Assessed with Neuroimaging and Epigenetic Approaches,” Prof. Metehan Çiçek talked about the interaction between emotions and timing. Drawing on experiences from his research, Dr. Çiçek explained how social stress changes perception of time, stating that it is widely known that emotions affect time perception. Highlighting the significant individual differences in the interaction between emotion and timing, he stated: “In our research, we used social stress, an ecologically valid model, to evaluate the neurological foundations of the interaction between emotion and timing.” Dr. Çiçek also presented his team’s studies that demonstrate how stress changes perception of time and which neural pathways are involved in the process using neuroimaging techniques.\n\nAnother invited speaker, Prof. Tilbe Göksun, in her speech titled “Multifunctionality of Gesture Use and Processing: An Individual Differences Approach,” discussed the multimodal nature of language, emphasizing that the gestures people use while speaking reflect their cognitive processes. Dr. Göksun addressed the role of gestures in compensating for verbal and visuospatial cognitive resources and the multifunctionality of gesture processing and production in various contexts and groups. She explained that one aspect of the multimodal nature of language is the hand movements of people during communication that represent their thoughts. Dr. Göksun highlighted the following key questions in this regard: “Why do people gesture in different situations? Do gestures serve similar functions across all these situations? How does the use of other cognitive resources interact with gesture usage and processing in different contexts?” She noted that these gestures not only reflect but can also alter the thinking processes of individuals and added that there are differences in how much information people derive from gestures and how they use them.\n\nDetailed information regarding the conference, as well as the proceedings book, can be accessed here.", "date": "2024-06-06T19:14:07+03:00", "question": "10th International Symposium on Brain and Cognitive Science held at METU\n\nIn alignment with the multifaceted nature of cognitive science, the symposium addressed its main subject from multiple dimensions through the presentations.\n\nThe 10th edition of the International Symposium on Brain and Cognitive Science (ISBCS) was held on June 1 at the METU Culture and Convention Center.

Led by Chemist Sevil Erkut from METU Central Laboratory on behalf of METU, the project involved 25 seventh-grade students selected from secondary schools affiliated with the Ministry of National Education and located in Çankaya, Ankara. The Green Chemistry: Green Earth project, conducted under METU’s coordination, was also supported by Petrol Ofisi and the Ministry of National Education, Çankaya Directorate of National Education.\nThe project addressed topics such as the application of green chemistry principles in daily life choices, waste management, and sustainable living practices through a combination of experimental and observational activities, alongside diverse learning methods. The project aimed to increase environmental awareness and foster greater sensitivity and responsibility towards environmental issues through an intensive five-day program.\nOn the first day of the program, participants had the opportunity to get to know each other before engaging in the Emotional Islands drama activity. In this activity, they performed a drama based on their interests and favorite things that they liked, allowing them to better connect with their friends with whom they would spend the entire week. Following the drama activity led by Assoc. Prof. Pervin Oya Taneri, participants listened to Assoc. Prof. Salih Özçubukçu’s presentation on the basics of Green Chemistry. Then, as part of the activity titled “I Wrote a Poem for My Green World,” participants composed poems together with Literature Teacher Özlem Göktaş by utilizing the knowledge they gained from the chemistry presentation.\n\nLater in the day, participants took part in the “Bioplastic Production” workshop, where they created biodegradable plastic with Chemist Fulya Karahan Dağ, further raising their awareness of environmental responsibility.\n\nOn the second day, students explored elements through augmented reality (AR). As part of this activity, elements were examined in 3D using AR element cards and a mobile app, and thus a potentially hazardous laboratory experiment was successfully conducted in a virtual environment using AR. The “Learning About Elements with AR Application” activity, presented by Chemist Mete Esencan, became one of the activities that attracted the most attention from students.\n\nIn the “Soap Foam Comparison Experiment,” the foam produced by synthetic soap containing harmful chemicals was compared with the foam of a naturally sourced, traditionally made soap, highlighting the differences in their ingredients. Based on the information provided by Chemistry Teacher Nazlıcan Demirkıran, participants discussed whether pleasant scent and foam are desirable qualities in hand and body cleaning products. Afterwards, students made glue using natural and commonly available household materials.\n\nIn the “Heroes of Recycling” activity, students worked with Visual Arts Teacher Semiha Seda Terzi and used this glue to design mini paintings with recycled materials.\n\nThe third day, which consisted of fieldwork activities at Lake Eymir, started with a presentation on waste delivered by Lect. Dr. Eda Tuna Öztürk. Then, the students participated in the “pH Measurement in Drinking Water and Wastewater” activity to conduct pH measurements under the guidance of trainers. Using pH strips, the participants measured the pH of various samples such as drinking water, vinegar, and purple cabbage juice, and conducted professional measurements using a pH meter. This activity also addressed the toxic effects of chemicals and how chemicals, when mixed with water, can alter its pH levels to the degrees it is no longer healthy for the human body.\n\nLater, in the “Nature’s Filter” activity, students filtered wastewater using sand and particles collected from the surroundings to produce clean water together with Lect. Dr. Tuğba Doğan. Charcoal as activated carbon, fine sand, cotton, and small stones were used to make filters. Students learnt the roles of the materials used in their filters in the process of purifying the water through this hands-on experience.\n\nIn the “What’s Natural? Let’s Think It Through” activity, chemical substances with clean and eco-friendly properties along with their characteristics were introduced to the participants, who were then asked to create products they could use in their daily lives from these materials. As part of the activity, participants made natural products such as roll-on deodorants, moisturizing hand cream, and disinfectants by using ingredients like baking soda, coconut oil, natural essential oils, vinegar, and turmeric. The final activity to mark the end of the day was the “Green Chemistry Kahoot Quiz,” conducted by Lect. Dr. İ. Cihan Ayanoğlu. A quiz on Green Chemistry was held via the digital learning and entertainment platform Kahoot, and the students ranking in the top three were awarded.\nOn the fourth day of the program, participants took part in two consecutive activities to prepare plant-based dyes and use these dyes to create designs on fabric bags. In the dye preparation stage, Res. Asst. Ece Ayça Erdoğan guided the participants to make colorful liquids using materials such as spinach, onion skins, turmeric, purple cabbage, hibiscus, and basil. Then, students enjoyed a design activity using these natural dyes that posed no harm to their skin or respiratory systems.\n\nAnother activity of the fourth day, “Green Orienteering,” involved a game where students reinforced their knowledge on Green Chemistry by answering questions at orienteering checkpoints. Under the supervision of Sports Coordinator Özgür Norman, students enthusiastically took part in the activity, navigating by using maps to find the checkpoints and enjoying the experience. Lastly, in the “Let’s Make Seed Balls” activity, participants were informed about seed balls. The effects of seed balls on nature, climate, and the future of the planet were discussed, after which the students worked together to make seed balls.\n\nThe final day of the program began with the “Biomimicry Presentation” and the “Card Matching Game” prepared by Chemist Sevil Erkut. Participants learnt about the concept of biomimicry, which involves imitating models, systems, and elements found in nature to solve complex human problems. The presentation helped students recognize the wise guidance that nature offers. Examples of nature-inspired designs were also highlighted. Following the presentation, a contest was held where students, divided into groups, played a card matching game featuring images of designs inspired by nature.\nIn the afternoon, an exhibition was organized to showcase the work students had completed throughout the activities in the program. METU President Prof. Ahmet Yozgatlıgil visited the exhibition, where he viewed the works of students and spoke to them to learn more about their projects.\n\nFinally, in the closing event of the Green Chemistry: Green Earth project, Prof. Yozgatlıgil presented certificates to the participants and the project team.\n\nThe project, led by Sevil Erkut from the METU Central Laboratory, included Assoc.

The system developed by the research team allows for the intelligent tracking of the queen bee, worker bees, and brood within the nesting cells of the hive through computer vision, making it possible to identify fundamental bee behaviors. The initial analysis results of the data collected by this system were presented in the article, whose authors include METU faculty members Assoc. Prof. Erol Şahin and Assoc. Prof. Hande Alemdar from the Department of Computer Engineering, Assoc. Prof. Ali Emre Turgut from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, as well as METU researchers Bilal Yağız Gündeğer, Erhan Ege Keyvan, and Babür Erdem, all of whom are also members of METU-ROMER. The robotic system enables the monitoring of both sides of a specially designed, transparent glass-walled “observation hive,” in which a colony of honey bees naturally going outside to forage from flowers resides. During the observation process, one of the cameras tracked the queen bee, while the other mapped the hive cells filled with brood, pollen, or honey. In order to avoid impacting the behaviors of bees, high-resolution recordings were made under infrared light and then analyzed with various artificial intelligence algorithms.\nThe system, operating in a research laboratory on the campus of the University of Graz as well as at METU-ROMER, generated approximately 1.4 terabytes of data daily. This data, consisting of high-resolution real-time footage of the queen bee’s interactions with worker bees, was stored for detailed analysis by project partners. The analysis of the collected data has made it possible to uncover the behavioral interactions within the colony and to gain a better understanding of the social behaviors inside the colony.\nFor the first time, this robotic system has made it possible to collect continuous, real-time, and highly accurate data on the activities within the hive over long-term periods. Through the analysis of the collected data with artificial intelligence, intriguing findings were reported on 23 distinct behavioral patterns that could be characterized as “Key Behavioral Metrics” for the bees.\nWith over 100 million recorded images, analyzing this data solely with the human eye was impossible; therefore, artificial intelligence technologies were utilized in the analysis process. Through the algorithms, information was obtained on the queen’s movements and egg-laying patterns, as well as the total number of worker bees in the hive. Additionally, the system made it possible to create a continuously updated map of the hive including brood, pollen, and honey, in order to measure the success rate of reproduction.\nThe article, published on October 16 in Science Robotics, one of the most prominent journals in its field, presents some remarkable findings, such as the queen bee covering approximately 1.5 kilometers within the hive over the course of a month, resting for a total of 1.5 hours at regular intervals, and laying an average of 187 eggs per day, even in October, which marks the end of the bee season.\nAmos Matsiko, one of the journal’s editors, noted that honeybees are essential for the pollination of food crops; however, their populations have been declining recently due to various environmental factors, including habitat loss. Matsiko explained that although previous scientific studies had attempted to understand honey bee behavior in their natural hive environments, these efforts were unsuccessful. He highlighted that this research article presents the development of an autonomous robotic system capable of continuously monitoring and tracking honey bees over a period of 30 days. Matsiko emphasized that this system could play a crucial role in identifying the basic behavioral characteristics of the queen bee, worker bees, and brood, in developing strategies for the conservation of this species.\nThe data collected as part of the RoboRoyale project is expected to be used in a variety of other analyses in the future.\nThrough this recently developed system, researchers have demonstrated that robotics and artificial intelligence technologies provide an unprecedented means of information acquisition for studies in behavior and ecology within different biological systems. The project team aims to expand these digital methods in future endeavors focused on other animal and plant species, thus being able to gain a deeper understanding of complex ecosystems.\nThe published research article can be accessed here, and further details about the project are available here.", "date": "2024-11-11T16:40:35+03:00", "question": "METU’s robotic system for tracking beehives featured on the cover of Science Robotics journal\n\nA system facilitating the observation and analysis of honeybee behaviors through robotics and artificial intelligence technologies has been developed.\n\nResearchers at the METU Center for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (ROMER), in collaboration with their international partners from England, Czech Republic, and Austria, have developed a system that enables tracking and analysis of honey bee behaviors through robotics and artificial intelligence technologies as part of the EU project titled RoboRoyale.\nThe research article titled “Autonomous Tracking of Honey Bee Behaviors Over Long-Term Periods with Cooperating Robots,” co-authored by researchers from METU, Durham University, University of Graz, and Czech Technical University, was published in the October issue of Science Robotics.

Additionally, the system made it possible to create a continuously updated map of the hive including brood, pollen, and honey, in order to measure the success rate of reproduction.\nThe article, published on October 16 in Science Robotics, one of the most prominent journals in its field, presents some remarkable findings, such as the queen bee covering approximately 1.5 kilometers within the hive over the course of a month, resting for a total of 1.5 hours at regular intervals, and laying an average of 187 eggs per day, even in October, which marks the end of the bee season.\nAmos Matsiko, one of the journal’s editors, noted that honeybees are essential for the pollination of food crops; however, their populations have been declining recently due to various environmental factors, including habitat loss. Matsiko explained that although previous scientific studies had attempted to understand honey bee behavior in their natural hive environments, these efforts were unsuccessful. He highlighted that this research article presents the development of an autonomous robotic system capable of continuously monitoring and tracking honey bees over a period of 30 days. Matsiko emphasized that this system could play a crucial role in identifying the basic behavioral characteristics of the queen bee, worker bees, and brood, in developing strategies for the conservation of this species.\nThe data collected as part of the RoboRoyale project is expected to be used in a variety of other analyses in the future.\nThrough this recently developed system, researchers have demonstrated that robotics and artificial intelligence technologies provide an unprecedented means of information acquisition for studies in behavior and ecology within different biological systems. The project team aims to expand these digital methods in future endeavors focused on other animal and plant species, thus being able to gain a deeper understanding of complex ecosystems.\nThe published research article can be accessed here, and further details about the project are available here.", "answer": "Researchers at the Middle East Technical University (METU) and international partners have developed a robotic system to track and analyze honeybee behaviors using robotics and artificial intelligence. The system, published in Science Robotics, enables the monitoring of queen bee, worker bees, and brood within the hive, generating 1.4 terabytes of data daily. Analysis of the data revealed 23 distinct behavioral patterns and provided insights into the queen bee's movements, egg-laying patterns, and the hive's structure.", "validated": "Language mismatch"}
