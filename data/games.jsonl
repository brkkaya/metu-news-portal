The Thing: Remastered is the remastered version of the 2002 video game based on John Carpenter's classic sci-fi horror movie The Thing. The Thing was a hit back when it released in 2002, with many praising it as one of the better survival-horror games of the era.\nConsidering the commercial success of The Thing video game, it's no surprise that there was some demand for it to be remastered for modern platforms. Nightdive Studios has stepped up to remaster The Thing, promising to deliver the game before the end of the year. With 2024 nearly at an end, no specific release date has been announced. However, it seems as though the cat has been let out of the bag.\nRELATED\nThe Thing (1982) Ending, Explained\nThe end of 1982's The Thing has confused fans for decades at this point, so what exactly happens?\nXbox recently published a post highlighting upcoming games for its platforms. As spotted by Pure Xbox, the post includes a December 5 release date for The Thing: Remastered, along with confirmation that the game is optimized for Xbox Series X/S consoles and supports Smart Delivery. It's quite possible that this release date is inaccurate, but there's also a chance that it is indeed the release date for The Thing: Remastered. With December 5 right around the corner, fans won't have to wait long to find out, in any case.\nThe Thing: Remastered Rumored Release Date\nThursday, December 5\nFor those unfamiliar with the game, The Thing video game serves as a sequel to the movie. Players are tasked with exploring the outpost from the movie to figure out what happened to the research team that was stationed there, only to find themselves having to fight off the titular \"thing.\" Blending survival-horror and third-person shooter elements, The Thing was mostly well-received at the time of its release in 2002.\nThe Thing: Remastered is bringing various enhancements to the table that should help the game reach a modern audience. The big thing is that The Thing: Remastered will feature better graphics than the original, but it will also enjoy improved performance and will be addressing some complaints fans had about the original. Notably, the wonky Infection system from the original game is being addressed by The Thing: Remastered, which should go a long way in improving the overall experience.\nFans of The Thing can rest assured that the remaster is in good hands. Nightdive Studios has built a reputation for delivering high-quality remasters of old-school games, and there's no reason to assume that the same won't hold true for The Thing: Remastered, whether it release on December 5 or a different date entirely.\nYour Rating\nRate Now\n10/10\nThe Thing\nThe Thing takes place shortly after Carpenter's 1982 film and plays off of many of the same themes of mood, distrust, fear, and monstrous baddies.

Konami has experimented with a wide variety of different events throughout the nearly three-year-long life of the digital version of its massively popular trading card game. Each month typically features one to two major Master Duel events, focusing around different deck-building restrictions, while smaller \"Duel Trial\" events utilize unique gimmicks for unusual dueling strategies. Now, Konami has rolled out its newest Duel Trial event.\nWhile Duel Trials have taken many different forms since their introduction to Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel, \"Time Travel\" events have been a particularly popular variant of the mini-event. Konami first debuted the \"Time Travel 2004\" event in March, bringing players back to the early days of the game and the iconic \"GOAT\" format. Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel would follow up on the idea during the summer, with \"Time Travel 2010\" featuring a banlist and cardpool based on the popular \"Edison\" format. The newest Duel Trial format takes inspiration from a game-changing set in Yu-Gi-Oh's history.\nRELATED\nYu-Gi-Oh Master Duel Announces New Limited-Time Event\nYu-Gi-Oh Master Duel reveals the newest limited-time event coming to the game, featuring a return to one of the game's beloved retro formats.\nYu-Gi-Oh Master Duel debuted its newest \"Duel Trial\" event on Thursday night, introducing the \"Time Travel 2014\" mini-event. The event features a format based on the release of Yu-Gi-Oh's \"Duelist Alliance\" set, featuring the debut of iconic archetypes like \"Shaddoll\" and \"Satellarknight,\" while utilizing the June 2014 banlist. The event provides players with three different Loaner decks based on themes like \"HERO\" and \"Dragons,\" while also allowing players to use their own decks. Winning three duels during the event rewards players with a free pack of Master Duel's newest Selection Pack, \"Geas of the Light.\"\nYu-Gi-Oh Master Duel Launches \"Time Travel 2014\" Event\nThe format for Master Duel's \"Time Travel 2014\" marks one of the most notable turning points in the Yu-Gi-Oh TCG's history. The event's cardpool comes just following the debut of Pendulum Monsters, ushering in a new era of gameplay with more explosive combos and powerful new cards. \"Shaddoll\" also took over the game as one of Yu-Gi-Oh's most dominant decks, owed to boss Monsters like \"El Shaddoll Winda\" and \"El Shaddoll Construct.\" Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel's \"Time Travel 2014\" event will run through the morning of December 3.\nYu-Gi-Oh Master Duel's newest event is far from the only change arriving to the digital trading card game in the coming weeks. Konami recently unveiled the newest banlist update for Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel, banning powerful draw Spell \"Pot of Prosperity\" and limiting cards like \"Fairy Tail - Snow\" and \"Dimension Shifter.\" December is also expected to welcome new Selection Packs to the game, introducing even more cards to the online TCG.

This new look at the game highlights some of Winter Burrow's survival elements, as well as the game's exploration mechanics as players explore a cute yet harsh snowy woodland.\nFirst revealed at Xbox's June Summer Game Fest showcase, Winter Burrow caught the eye of cozy game fans for its cute mouse protagonist and snowy winter environments. However, in the grand scheme of what's considered one of Xbox's best showcases ever, it wouldn't be wrong to say that Winter Burrow may have been overshadowed a bit by the likes of Perfect Dark and South of Midnight's gameplay reveals, announcements of Gears of War: E-Day and Doom: The Dark Ages, and so much more. Still, Winter Burrow has remained on Xbox Game Pass subscribers' wish lists and many are eager to see and learn more about the game.\nRELATED\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate Adds More Perks for November 2024\nXbox's popular Game Pass subscription service reveals this month's round of perks and goodies users can claim at no additional cost.\nFans of survival games are in luck today, as Winter Burrow has put out an all-new trailer, giving fans an in-depth look at the survival game's mechanics. The two-minute trailer is narrated by a developer from Pine Creek Games, the studio behind Winter Burrow, who sheds some light on the game's early narrative setup. The trailer gives fans a glimpse at the game's UI, which looks to include a compass, item belt, and what seem like health, hunger, and warmth bars in the lower left corner. The burrow, which will serve as players' home base, was a big focus of the trailer. It's here where players will be able to craft items, knit sweaters to keep warm in the cold, bake pies to eat, and rest up for the next day of scavenging.\nDay One Game Pass Title Winter Burrow Releases New Trailer\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nThe areas outside the burrow are where players will need to explore in order to gather resources like wood, rocks, and other materials. However, players will need to contend with both the freezing cold weather and creepy critters like beetles and bugs that will need to be dealt with through what seems like a simple, light combat system. Not all the creatures outside the burrow are hostile though, as the trailer showed some of the friendly NPC animals players can meet, like a bear and a frog, who may be of help with useful survival tips. It seems like Winter Burrow's gameplay loop will involve going out to explore and gather resources before heading back to the burrow to rest up and prepare for the next outing.\nWinter Burrow's new trailer didn't divulge a specific release date; it's sticking with its initial 2025 window. Considering the game's cozy winter setting, it would be a perfect game for January or February. Nevertheless, Steam users can wishlist the game and can also try out the game's demo, while Xbox users will have to wait for the game's full launch, which will be part of Xbox Game Pass on day one.\n5 Images\nWinter Burrow\nWinter Burrow is a cozy woodland survival game. Explore, gather resources, craft tools, knit warm sweaters, bake pies and meet the locals!\n\nIn Winter Burrow, you play a mouse who returns from the big city to find their childhood home in ruins. To make matters worse, your Aunt (who was supposed to be looking after it) has gone missing. Restore your broken-down childhood burrow to its former glory so you can relax in front of the fireplace.\n\n\nBrave the elements and journey out into the frozen wilderness to collect vital resources for both yourself and your new home. Beware of the insect wildlife and remember that nobody survives on their own; find new friends, expand your survival handbook and solve the mystery of what happened to your Aunt.\n\n\nWinter Burrow is a survival game you play at your own pace. Customize your character, decorate your burrow and choose a path that fits your play style.

Customization has been a constant talking point among fans of the popular shooter. Players have asked for the ability to recolor their armor, or even fully customize loadouts with a transmog system, for quite some time. Helldivers 2 has also fallen under occasional scrutiny for failing to meet the cosmetic demands of its voracious fanbase.\nHelldivers 2 is a co-op third-person shooter that allows up to four players to fight off the tyranny of automatons and terminids in the name of Super Earth and democracy. The breakout hit was released early in 2024 and immediately struck a chord with fans for its fast-paced action, tense gameplay, and wide range of weapons. The title courted controversy with its PC version when Sony decided to require PlayStation accounts for Steam players, but that hasn't stopped the game from continuing to grow its fanbase. The Game Awards have even nominated the shooter in several categories for 2024.\nRELATED\nHelldivers 2's Missing Illuminate Faction Might Set an Unfortunate Precedent\nThe anticipated Illuminate faction still nowhere to be seen in Helldivers 2 might be an unfortunate sign regarding a particular aspect of the game.\nA fan of Helldivers 2 tagged the creative director of the game in a post on Twitter. It was day 16 of the fan asking for the ability to customize their Helldiver's armor by recoloring it, and Pilestedt responded by saying the Helldivers 2 team was \"looking into it.\" While this doesn't confirm any sort of timeline for the requested feature, it looks like players may have a new level of customization to look forward to in the future. The game already features a lot of ways for players to customize their characters and interact with one another, especially when it comes to including interactive emotes in Helldivers 2. Adding even more options would likely continue to win over players and keep the fanbase happy.\nHelldivers 2 May Soon Let Players Customize the Color of Their Armor\nIt's important to note that allowing players to recolor their armor would not be the same as a full transmog system. Shortly after release, the creative director stated the customization feature wouldn't make sense for Helldivers 2. Pilestedt believes the game's varied armors often look different because they serve different purposes, meaning a transmog system wouldn't fit the developer's vision.\nMany fans feel the option to recolor one's armor would be a welcome addition to the popular action game. Helldivers 2 recently increased its in-game store prices, which didn't go over well with some players. However, the ability to further customize armor might make those prices a little easier to swallow. While customizing colors isn't quite the full transmog system some players have been asking for, it would be a bit of a compromise on the part of Arrowhead.\n6 Images\nYour Rating\nRate Now\nLeave a Review\n8.6/10\nHelldivers 2\nDo you believe in freedom?

The South Korean studio is naturally hoping that the move to another platform will add to Stellar Blade's sales tally, though it has yet to clarify some crucial details concerning the upcoming port.\nThe game itself initially launched for the PlayStation 5 in late April 2024. Shift Up revealed it was considering a Stellar Blade PC port in June 2024. The developer then confirmed it had committed to bringing the game to PC two months later.\nRELATED\nNovember 20 is Going to Be a Big Day for Stellar Blade Fans\nStellar Blade fans should mark November 20 on their calendars, as this will be a very special day for the popular action game.\n4\nAnother update on the project was shared on November 12, just as Shift Up published its latest consolidated financial report. During a Q&A session that followed, a company representative was asked about the status of the Stellar Blade PC port and responded that this version of the game is currently targeting a 2025 release.\nShift Up Has Big Expectations For Stellar Blade PC Port\nAsked about the game's PC prospects, the official confirmed that Shift Up has big expectations for the port. Between Valve's growing share of the AAA gaming market and the recent success of the somewhat mechanically similar Black Myth: Wukong on Steam, the South Korean studio anticipates that Stellar Blade will do well on PC. \"We expect to see more success on PC than consoles,\" a company representative said.\nWe expect to see more success on PC than consoles.\nAs for what kind of baseline the studio is targeting, it last said that Stellar Blade sold one million copies on the PS5. The action game reached that milestone in late June 2024, about two months following its original release. While Shift Up did not provide a breakdown of its previously reported sales figure, Circana estimates that Stellar Blade was the top-selling game in the U.S. in April 2024, despite hitting the market at the very end of the month. Stateside consumers have hence seemingly significantly contributed to its global sales.\nStellar Blade PC Port's Publisher Remains Unclear\nAnother thing that Shift Up is yet to clarify is who will publish the game's PC version. PlayStation handled the distribution of the PS5 original, but that was only after Sony sought a timed exclusivity deal for Stellar Blade. This happened after former SIE Worldwide Studios President Shuhei Yoshida played a prototype of the game and advised the company to pursue a publishing deal with Shift Up in 2021. The collaboration allowed Stellar Blade to grow in scope, according to a March 2024 report from French YouTuber Julien Chieze. Stellar Blade's credits support this theory, as they give \"special thanks\" to Yoshida.\nSource: Julien Chieze / YouTube\n7 Images\nYour Rating\nRate Now\nLeave a Review\n8.2/10\nStellar Blade\nRECLAIM EARTH FOR HUMANKIND The future of humanity hangs in the balance in Stellar Blade, an all-new story-driven action adventure on PlayStation\u00ae5.

While not nearly as powerful as its fully evolved form Dragonite, Dratini is widely regarded among fans as one of the cutest Dragon-type critters that Pokemon fans can find.\nBeing an evolutionary predecessor to Dragonite, the first pseudo-legendary Pokemon that the franchise ever introduced, it's no surprise that Dratini and its family of evolved forms have frequently appeared in Pokemon fan artwork since the late 90s. Dragon-type enthusiasts and imaginative artists alike have collectively designed a plethora of alternative forms for Dragonite and its pre-evolutions over the years, from custom Mega Forms to regional variants and even alternate shiny versions.\nRELATED\nPokemon Scarlet and Violet Announce Mid-November Tera Raid Battle\nPokemon Scarlet and Violet reveal the second Seven-Star Tera Raid battle trainers can challenge throughout November.\nOne member of the Pokemon community, known online as MediocrePlayer, recently shared something a bit different: a hand-made wood carving they created that depicts Dratini with astonishing accuracy. This tiny Dratini model quickly captured the hearts of thousands of Pokemon fans online, and boasts a beautiful beige color thanks to the maple wood that the model was carved from. Though the carefully carved shapes and curves speak to an incredible level of crafting skill, many admiring Pokemon fans appreciate the slightly alternative appearance that the wood color provides, with some viewing it as something that would make a nice alternate shiny form for the Pokemon.\nDratini Wood Carving Almost Looks Like a New Form\nWith Pokemon standing tall as the single highest-grossing media franchise of all time, its games, merchandise, and anime series continue to reach millions of people all around the world. As a result of both the series' vast influence, the franchise enjoys a remarkably creative fanbase. Fan artwork in all of its forms has persisted since the Gen 1 games and seems to have flourished even further in recent years as fans have been inspired to create new forms of their favorite Pokemon thanks to the introduction of features such as regional variants and Paradox Pokemon in the games.\nEven during the unusually long period between Pokemon Scarlet and Violet's DLC and the launch of Pokemon Legends: Z-A in 2025, the community has been busy bringing their imagination to life through artwork. While fans have seen little news with regard to the next major Pokemon release, this has left them all the more excited to see the new creature designs and Mega Forms that may appear in the Kalos region next year in Pokemon Legends: Z-A.\nPokemon\nPokemon is a franchise that needs no introduction. One of the most successful media empires in history, Pokemon spans games, television, films, manga, merchandise, music, and more.\n  Created by\nSatoshi Tajiri"}

While Dragon Age: Origins introduced a modern take on the CRPG genre back in 2009, the series has since evolved in a completely different direction, favoring the combat system of BioWare's other big franchise \u2013 Mass Effect. Unlike its predecessors, Dragon Age: The Veilguard embraced an ARPG identity, and many players have described its gameplay as a blend of Mass Effect 3 and God of War.\nThough The Veilguard enjoys largely positive reviews from fans and critics alike, and continues to top the charts across all platforms, the first three Dragon Age games have a special place in the heart of many a player. BioWare has often been asked about the possibility of remastering Dragon Age: Origins and its sequel, or to even remake them on the Frostbite Engine.\nRELATED\nBaldur's Gate 3 Publishing Director Weighs in on Dragon Age: The Veilguard\nBaldur's Gate 3's publishing director talks about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, revealing their thoughts on BioWare's upcoming action RPG.\n1\nJohn Epler directly addressed the topic during his interview with Rolling Stone, as well as clarified some of the difficulties that BioWare would run into if it attempted to give Dragon Age the Legendary Edition treatment. Namely, whereas the Mass Effect trilogy was made on the Unreal Engine, Dragon Age shifted from Eclipse to Frostbite after the second game. \u201cI think I\u2019m one of about maybe 20 people left at BioWare who\u2019s actually used Eclipse,\u201d Epler says. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s not going to be as easy as Mass Effect, but we do love the original games. Never say never, I guess that\u2019s what it comes down to.\u201d\nBioWare Addresses the Possibility of a Dragon Age Remaster\nThere is another matter to consider. Unlike Mass Effect, the Dragon Age series was never quite as confident in its identity. Each subsequent sequel was a major departure from its predecessor, and though it worked well with the franchise's anthology format, it now makes the idea of creating a Dragon Age remastered collection a far more complicated affair. Not only are there technical hurdles to solve due to a lack of developers familiar with Eclipse, but porting the games over to Frostbite would likely necessitate changes to gameplay.\nBioWare confirmed that Dragon Age: The Veilguard would feature no DLCs and that the team is now committed to developing the next Mass Effect game. While Epler claims that BioWare has embraced its single-player roots after the player feedback on Anthem, he does point towards games such as Final Fantasy 14 as examples of how a multiplayer title can still tell a strong story. It remains to be seen how BioWare will continue to build upon its beloved IPs, but the success of Dragon Age: The Veilguard has certainly proven that the world of Thedas is still worth investing in.\n8 Images\nYour Rating\nRate Now\nLeave a Review\n7/10\nDragon Age: The Veilguard\nRPG\nSystems\nOpenCritic Reviews\nTop Critic Rating:\n81/100\nCritics Recommend:\n70%\nFranchise\nDragon Age\nPlatform(s)\nPC , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series S , Xbox Series X\nReleased\nOctober 31, 2024\nDeveloper(s)\nBioWare\nPublisher(s)\nElectronic Arts\nEngine\nFrostbite\nESRB\nM For Mature 17+ // Blood, Nudity, Sexual Themes, Strong Language, Violence\nExpand\nSee at Official Site\nSee at Playstation Store\nSee at Steam\nSee at Xbox Games Store"}
